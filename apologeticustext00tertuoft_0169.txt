a brave man, what a conqueror even in captivityl' Anax-
archus, when he was being pommelled to death with a barley
pestle, kept saying: ‘Pound, pound away: for it is the bodily
coating of Anaxarchus, not Anaxarchus himself, that you are
pounding! ' ‘Oh the great-souled philosopher, who could
actually joke about such a death as his!' I leave out
those who bargained for fame with their own swords or some
other milder form of death. For, 10, even rivalries of tortures
are crowned by you. An Athenian harlot who had already
wearied out the executioner‚ at last bit through her tongue and
spat it out into the face of the cruel tyrant, that she might
spit out her own voice also, 10 prevent her from being able to
confess the names of the conspirators‚ even in case she might
give in and desire to do so. Zeno of Elea, being consulted by
Dionysius as to what was the benefit 01 philosophy, when he
had replied: ‘Contempt 01 death,' without showing feeling he
was thereupon exposed to the scourges of the tyrant and con-
tinued to seal his opinion even up to the point 01 death.
Assuredly the scourges 01 1110 Spartans, embittered, as they

the family a reputation for endurance, in proportion to the
blood they have shed. Here is a glory licensed because human,
to which neither reckless prejudice nor desperate persuasion
is ascribed in despising death and every sort 01 cruelty, to
which it is allowed to endure more for one’s city, for the
empire, and for friendship, than it is allowed to endure 101
God! And yet for all these you cast statues and write inscrip-
tions and engrave titles to last for ever; certainly you your-
selves also, in so far as you can, in a certain sense confer resurrec-
tion on the dead by means of your monuments3 while he who
hopes for a real resurrection from God‚ if he suffer for God, is
thought insane. But go on thus, ye excellent governors, and
you will be all the more popular with the mob if you sacrifice
Christians to their wishes: crucify‚ torture, condemn, annihilate
us: your injustice is a proof of our innocence. It is for that
reason that God allows us 10 suffer these things. For quite
recently by condemning a Christian woman to the lust of man
rather than to a lion, you confessed that the stain upon chastity
is reckoned more heincus among us than any punishment and
any death. Nor yet doth your cruelty, though each act be
more exquisite than the last, profit you3 it is rather an attrac-
tion to our sect. We spring up in greater numbers the more we
are mown down by you: the blood of the Christians is the seed
of a new life. Many among yourselves exhort men to the
