PREFACE

HE late Professor John E. B. May or, during his tenure of
the professmship 01 Latin at Cambridge⁷ frequently lectured
011 the Apoloygs of Tertullian in the Du 111115 Schools. About
the year 1892 110 55 rote out his notes in a copy of Oehler⁷s
earlier edition (Halle, 1849), that had been interleaved With
sheets of paper about twice the size of the pages of the book
itself. These notes were added to from time to time down to
the year 1907, 11 1101 later, and they formed the matter of his
lectures. Already in 1893 he began to publish them in The
Journal of Plziloloyy, but the publication never went beyond
the end of the fifth chapter.

After his death on December 1, 1910, his executors considered
the advisability of publishing the whole of the notes, and
honoured me with the request to edit them for publication.
Ι had heard the lectures throughout two or more terms of my
undergraduate period at Cambridge, and had been profoundly
infiuenced by them. Ι therefore felt it binding on me to
suspend my own work and perform this act 01 pietas.

The executors first arranged with Mr E. S. Payne of Clifton‚
BristoL for a copy of the notes as a basis for the proposed
publication. Though the Professor‘s handxvriting is beautifully
clear, it is at the same time so microscopic that this 55 as 110
light task to perform. Mr Payne also verified man) 01 the
references, and appended a number of useful remarks on 1110
notes themselves.

It may be at once admitted that 01115 the P1ofessor himself,
or some one equally learned, could edit these notes in a satis—
factory manner. I am fully conscious of my own unfitness
for the task, which has been very heavy. I have felt it necessary
to compare Mr Payne’s copy with the original MS, in which
work I received valued help from the friend of thirty years,
Mr ,J ames Taylor of the Aberdeen Centre for the Training 01
Teachers3 but this is only part of what was required. I have
had 10 put the notes in correct sequence, to reduce to order
the somewhat chaotic state of the references and quotations
within the notes themselves, to supply references never filled
