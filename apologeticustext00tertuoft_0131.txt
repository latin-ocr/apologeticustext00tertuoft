inquire into the safety of Caesar, except he who meditates or
desires something against it, or who hopes and xvaits for some-
thing to follow after'.l For one does not consult about friends
with the same feeling as about masters. The solicitude of
kinship is of a different nature from that of servitude.

CHAP. XXXV I. If this is so, that those are found out to be
6116111166 who were called Romans, why are we, who are but
thought to be enemies, denied to be Romans? We cannot be
at the same time non· Ii-omans and enemies, since those who w ere
considered Romans are found to be enemies. The fact is that
the loyalty and worship and faith that are due to the emperors
do not consist in services such as even enmity 0311 perform
rather as a cloak to itself, but in those habits, which are as
trulv demanded by the godhead as thev must be shown
towards mankind in general. For indeed it is not to the
emperors alone that such services of good will are due from us.
No benefit that we accomplish pays any regard to special
individuals, because it is to ourselves that we perform it, and
we do not snatch at payment from a man either of praise or
of reward, but from God, who exacts and rewards impartial
kindness. We are the same to the emperors as we are 10 0111
neighbours. For We are forbidden to wish 61711, to do evil to
say evil, to think evil, about any one without distinction.
VVhatsoever is not permitted against the emperor, neither is
it permitte‘d against any one3 and what 1s permitted against
no one, is perhaps all the more forbidden against him whom
God has made 60 great. ⁴

CHA.P XXXVII. If we are ordered, as We said above 10
10176 our enemies, whom have we Ι(ἷ1Ἒ1”ἇ”1ῖ3162 Likexx ise if 11 11611
1³'nJu1-ed we are forbidden to retaliate, lest by oui action 1176 should
put ourselves on the lev el of our enemy whom 0311 1176 injure?
For consider this matter yourselves. How often do you rage
fiercely against the Christians in obedience partly 10 your
own feelings, partly to the laws? Ηο11 often also, passing
you over, does the hostile rabble of its 011711 right attack us
with stones and fires? With the very rage of Bacchanals,
they do not spare Christians ev en xx hen they are dead, nay from
the rest of the tomb, from the sort of refuge that death affords,
they would drag them 311 ay, cut them up, tear them to pieces,
when they are already decomposed, 1111611 already not even
entire. Yet what instance did x ou ever note1 of our retaliation
