in view of the reality of innocence. A man's knowledge for
the pointing out of what is really good, is just as great as his
authority for exacting it: the former is just as easily deceived
as the latter is slighted. And further which is the more com-
prehensive, to say: ‘Thou shalt do no murder,' or to teach:
'Do not even become angry' ¹? What is more absolute, to forbid
adultery, or even to bar man from the solitary desire of the
eyes? Which shows a deeper experience, the prohibition from
evil-doing, or the further prohibition from evil-speaking?
Which shows better instruction, not to permit injury, or not
even to allow retaliation for injury'? Provided, however, you
know that your very laws also, which seem to tend in the direc-
tion of uprightness, have borrowed their form from the divine
law as the older pattern. We have spoken already about the
age 01 Moses. But how little is the authority of human laws,
since a man has 3 chance both to escape them, and very often
to lie hid in his crimes, and sometimes to set them at nought,
sinning involuntarily] or of necessity? Reflect also on them in
view 01 the shortness 01 any punishment, which will not in any
case last beyond death. So also Epicurus makes light 01 311
10111110 and pain, by declaring indeed that if slight it is con-
temptible, while if great it will not last long. In very truth
we who 310 examined before God who searches all, we who look
forward to everlasting punishment 110111 Him 30 0111· due, are
the only ones who attain uprightness, both in view 01 1110
1111111000 01 knowledge and in view 01 1110 difficulty 01 0011-
cealment· and in view 01 1110 greatness 01 1110 10111110, which
is not lasting only but everlasting, fearing Him, whom even he
himself who judges the 10311111 11111 113νο 10 1031, that is, fearing
God, not the pro-consul.

CHAP. XLVI. We have maintained our ground, I think,
against the denunciation 01 311 charges, which clamours 101 1110
blood 01 1110 Christians. We have shown our whole position,
and in what ways we can prove it to be such as we have shown,
by the trustworthiness, 01 course, and the antiquity 01 0111
sacred writings, and also from the confession of spiritual powers.
Who will dare to refute us, not by skill in words, but by the same
method, by which we established our proof, namely on the ground
of truth? But while our truth is displayed to every man, mean-
time unbelief, confounded as it is by the goodness of this sect,
which has now become known to experience, as well as from
intercourse with it, does not of course regard it as 3 divine
question, but rather as a kind of philosophy. Philosophers also,
