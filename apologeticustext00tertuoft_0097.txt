their partisanship forcibly obtained from Pontius Pilate, who
at that time was governing Syria on behalf of the Romans,
J esus’ surrender for crucifixion. He himself also had foretold
that they would do so; a small thing, if the prophets had
not also foretold it earlier. And further, on being crucified he
displayed many signs peculiar to that death. For he released
his spirit of his own accord with a word, anticipating the duty
of the executioner. At the same moment daylight was with.-
drawn, though the sun was then marking the middle of his
course. Those who did not know that this also had been
prophesied1 with regard to Christ, thought that it was an eclipse3
and yet you have that overshadowing of the sky recorded in
your secret records. Then the Jews took him down, laid him in
a tomb, and further surrounded it with a large band of soldiers,
to guard it carefully, lest his disciples might remove the corpse
by stealth, because he had foretold that on the third day he
would rise again from death, and thus escape those who suspected
them. But lo, on the third day there was a sudden earthquake
and the massive stone which had blocked the entrance to the
tomb was rolled back3 the guard dispersed in panic, though
no disciples appeared, and nothing was found in the tomb
except the grave clothes. Nevertheless, the rulers, whose
interest it was both to spread a wicked tale and to recall from
the faith their tributaries and dependents, spread abroad the
report that he had been stolen by his disciples. For neither
did he show himself to the crowd, lest the irreligious might be
freed from their mistake, and also in order that belief, which is
destined to receive no little reward, should be strengthened by
difficulty. However with certain disciples he lived in Galilee,
a district of Judea, for forty days, teaching them what they
were to teach. Then, having ordained them to the duty of
preaching throughout the world, he was taken up to heaven in
a cloud, much more truly than people like Proculus are wont
to assert among you about Romulus. All these things with
reference to Christ, Pilate, who himself also in his own con-
science was now a Christian, reported to the then emperor
Tiberius. But even the emperors would have believed on
Christ, if either emperors had not been necessary to the world
or if it had been possible for Christians too to be emperors.
His disciples also scattered throughout the world in accordance
with the order of their teacher God. They themselves too
having gladly suffered much at the hands of persecuting Jews,
of course for their confidence in the truth, at last through the
cruelty of Nero sowed the seed'of Christian martyrdom at Rome.
