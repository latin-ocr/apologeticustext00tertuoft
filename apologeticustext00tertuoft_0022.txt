xviii INTRODUCTION

of the adaptations 01 Freund Ι have for many years employed
two copies 01 Riddle-White, and (01 late) two copies of LeWis-
short, as a basis for annotations3 but young scholars, who
use a lexicon not so much to add to or correct its statements‚
as to learn the usage 01 the language‚ ought to employ Gesner
or Forcellini or Scheller habitually. For a portion 01 the
alphabet (110111 D—K) by far the completest storehouse is the
'Thesaurus der klassischen Latinitatis? begun by Georges, and
continued from D onwards by Gustav Miihlmann (LeipZ.
1854-68y

Any 01 the old Latin-English lexicons‚ from Cooper to the
complete editions 01 Ainsworth‚ give 131 more racy, homespun
English for the Latin words, than the books which now com-
mand the market. Lewis-Short has an improved orthography
and some additions from Georges and various commentaries;
also a few articles (eg. cum conj. and prep„ sui, suus) are care-
fully and independently executed3 «but in some points the
changes from Riddle-White are for the worse.

In the ‘ Bibliographical Clue to Latin Literature’ I recorded
under each author the then aids (indexes cet.) to the study 01 ’
his language3 it is well to remember that the ‘Delphin'
classics (Valpy’s reprint is very accurate, and adds many useful
commentaries to the original quartos) and also Lemaire’s supply
complete indexes to many authors. Merguet is about half way
through the Herculean task 01 3 concordance to Cicero3 he
and others have brought out three rival lexicons to Caesar:
Teubner's press is engaged on lexicons to Livy and Tacitusl.
In Teubner's ‘bibliotheca' some authors, chiefly technical, as
Cassius Felix, Iulius Valerius cet„ are furnjshed with indexes.
The Berlin ‘Monumenta Germaniae historica' and the Vienna
library 01 the fathers have indeed indexes‚ but in many cases
by no means exhaustive3 eg. not Reifferscheid, but Forcellini,
informs us that the rare word bacula (dim. 01 baca) occurs
thrice in Arnobius. Ο1 late years the French have returned to
