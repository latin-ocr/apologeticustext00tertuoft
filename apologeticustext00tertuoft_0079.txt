311 beasts 01 burden, as well as to asses, heads and bodies both,
along with their own goddess Epona. Perhaps our fault consists
in the fact that amongst the worshippers 01 631116 and beasts
01 311 kinds we worship the ass alone.

But he too who thinks that we adore the 61033 will be our
fellow-worshipper. When some piece 01 wood is propstiated, no
matter 101 1116 fashion as long as the quality 01 1116 1113161131 13
1116 331116, 110 11131161 101· 1116 101111 33 10118 33 1116 8οᾶ 13 bodily
in the image. And yet what a great difference there is between
the upright 01 3 61033 and the Athenian Pallas or the Egyptian
Ceres, who stand forth 1011111633, 3 1011811 stake, a shapeless bit
01 wood! Every piece 01 wood that is fixed 111 1116 ground in
an 61661 position 13 part 01 3 61033; we, perhaps, worship an
unmutilated and complete god. I have said that the sculptors
01 ι170111 gods make a beginning with a cross: but you also
worship Victories‚ although, in trophies‚ crosses form the
inside part. The whole religion 01 1116 Roman camp consists
in worshipping the standaffls, in swearing by the standards, and
in setting the standards above all the gods. All those rows 01
11113863 011 1116 standards 316 but 33 necklaces 01 6103363; 111036
pennons on the ensigns and banners are the robes 01 6103363.
Ι commend your scrupulous attitude: you would not dedicate
6103363 11131 were bare and undraped. Others, certainly With
greater semblanoe 01 11311116 and 01 1111111, believe the sun to
be our god. If so, we shall perhaps be classed with the Pemians,
although we do not worship a representation 01 1116 31111 011 3
linen 610111, 311166 everywhere we have the sun himself within
his own hemisphere. Lastly the suspicion arises 110111 1116
knowledge that we turn 10 1116 6331 111 prayer. But many 01
you 100 with an affectation 01 sometimes worshipping heavenly
bodies move your lips towards the rising sun. Likewise 11 we
give rein to joy on Sundays, in a 131 different way from sun
worship, we are only second to those who devote Saturday
(Sabbath) to idleness and 163311118, and who also deviate from
the J ewish custom 01 which they are ignorant. But recently in
this city, what is really a new representation 01 0111 god has
been made public, since a certain criminal, hired to trick the
wild beasts, exhibited a picture with an inscription to the
following effect: ‘The Christian God, the Offspring 01 311 Ass.²
He had asses' ears, one 1001 11001661, was dressed in the toga and
carried a book. We laughed both at the name and the figure.
But they were bound to worship at once a two-formed divinity,
because they have welcomed, as gods, creatures with heads both
01 dog and 01 11011, with the horns 01 3 8031 and a ram, others
with goats' bodies from the loins downwards, and like serpents
