(although it does matter whether it is child-murder or homicide)
Ι will appeal to the people. How many of those standing around
and panting for the blood 01 1110 Christians, aye even 01 your-
selves, magistrates most just and severe against us, should Ι prick
in their consciences‚ 101· putting to death the children born to
them? Since there is a difference also in the manner of the
death, it is assuredly more cruel to suffocate them by drowning
or to expose them to cold and starvation and the dogs, 101
017011 311 older person would prefer to die by the sword. But
to us, to whom homicide has been once for all forbidden, it is
not permitted to break up even what has been conceived in the
womb, while as yet the blood is being drawn (from the parent
body) 101 3 1111111311 1110. Prevention 01 birth is premature murder,
and it makes no difference whether it 18 3 1110 already 110111 that
one snatches away, or a 1110 111 1110 301 01 being born that one
destroys; that which 18 10 110 3 human-being 18 3180 1111111311;
the whole fruit is already actually present in the seed. With
regard to banquets 01 blood and such like tragic dishes, you may
read whether it is not somewhere stated (it is in Herodotus,
Ι think) that certain tribes had arranged the tasting 01 blood
drawn from the arms 01 110111 81(108 to signify ratification 01 3
treaty. Something of⁸the same kind was tasted also under
Catiline. They say that among certain tribesmen 01 13110
Scythians also each dead person becomes 10οᾶ 101 1118 own
relations. But Ι 3111 wandering too 131. 011 11118 very day,
in this very country, blood from a wounded thigh, caught in
a palm 01 the hand and given to her worshippers to drink,
marks the votaries1 01 Bellona. Again, what 01 111080 who, by
way 01 healing epilepsy, at the gladiatorial shOW, drain with
eager 1111181 the blood 01 slaughtered criminals, while it is still
fresh and flowing down 110111 1110 11110312 Or what 01 those,
who dine on bits 01 wild-beast from the arena, who seek a slice
01 11031 01 stag? That boar in the struggle wiped off the blood
from him whom he had first stained with gore; that stag
wallowed in a gladiator's blood. The paunches 01 the very
bears are eagerly sought, while they are yet gorged with un-
digested human flesh3 thus flesh that has been fed on man is
forthwith vomited by man. You that eat such things, how 131
“ removed you are 110111 the 103818 01 the Christians! But are
those others less guilty, who with savage lust gloat over human
bodies, because they devour them alive? are they any the less
dedicated to filth by· human blood, because they lick up what
is about to become blood? they do not absolutely eat infants,
but rather those that are grown up. Your crimes ought to
