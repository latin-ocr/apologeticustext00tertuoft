INTRODUOTION ’ xvii

remark that Rigault’s glossary is convenient 101· annotation.
This book and Blunt’s manuscript lectures on the early fathers
should certainly be secured 101 the university which he adorned.
The Germans are no doubt the most active workers in the
patristic vineyard3 but how few 01 them are scholars like
Burton or Blunt, Kaye or Field!

LANGUAGE.

Of existing glossaries to Tertullian, those 01 Rigault,
Semler (also in Migne) and (the best) Oehler, all are necessary.
[The language 01 Το11311111311, so far as comprised in the two
already published volumes 01 13110 Vienna edition, has been
completely recorded on slips 101· 13110 Thesaurus Linquae Latinae.
A complete index 130 the Apoloyeticus has been made by Henen z
see the additions to the Bibliography. A. S.] General lexicons
01 independent value are Faberl (best ed. by Leichius, Francos.
1749, 101.), 3 favorite with Dr Westcott; Rob. Stephens (ed.
Gesner, 4 vols. 1749; the ed. 01 Ant. Birr, Basss. 1740, 101.
4 vols, has inedited notes 01 Henry Stephens); Forcellini,
two editions 01 which are still incomplete, that by De Vit
(lexicon and glossary and a large part 01 the valuable ‘Ono-
masticon' have appeared), and that by Corradini (incorporating
Klotz); Scheller (3rd ed. Leipz. 1804—5, 5 vols. 8vo3 Ι have
Madvig’s copy), translated, without the instructive and pathetic
preface, by Riddle 101 the Oxford Press (101.) ; Klotz; (Freund's
book, which has supplied the basis 01 ninety-nine hundredths
01 the lexicons sold in England for many years, is, after the
letter C, a most careless compilation from Forcellini); and,
fullest 01 311 in vocabulary, and necessary as a supplement
even to Forcellini, Georges. [This honour now belongs to
Nouveau Dictiounaz're Latin-Fra7zcaz'3...par E. Benoist et H.
Goelzer, Paris 1893, for the whole alphabet, to the Sth edition
01 Georges by his son H. Georges, Hannover and Leipzig,
1912-1916, for three quartem, and to the Thesaurus Liuyuae
Latinae, Leipzig, 1900 ff, 101· A—Dimico, FssFamilia. A. S.]

of Classical and Sacred Philology 11 (Cambr. 1855), 277—290.
