APOLOGETIOVS 11 41

while you deny the maker. Of course if they had been able to
make themselves gods, they would never have been men,
possessing as they did the command of a higher state. There-
fore, if there is anyone who makes gods, I return to my
examination of the causes for making gods out 01 111011 311(1

it is unworthy of him that he should need the service of anyone,
especially of a dead man, since, if he were likely to need the
service of a dead person, it would have been a w rorthier course to
have made some god from the first. But Ι 800 110 100111 101
811011 aid either. For the whole body of the world, whether
unborn or unmade, as Pythagoras believed, or born and made,
as Plato believed, was surely found to have been once for all
arranged and equipped and ordered in its present structure
entirely under the guidance 01 reason. That could not be
imperfect which has perfected all things. Nothing was waiting
for Saturn and Saturn’s race. Men will show themselves fools
if they are not convinced that, from the beginning, rains fell
from heaven, stars twinkled, the greater lights have shown their
power, thunders have roared, and Jove himself has feared the
thunderbolts which you place in his hand3 moreover every sort

01 Bacchus and Ceres and Minerva, nay even before that first
man, if there were 811011, because nothing devised for the pre-
servation and support of man could be introduced later than his
own appearance. Lastly, the gods are said to have discovered, fs
not to have originated, these necessaries of life. That however
which is discovered, existed, and that which existed will not be
counted as his who discovered it, but as his who originated it3
for it existed before it was found. But 11, Bacchus is a god
because he pointed out the vine, Lucullus, who first made
cherries from Pontus known to Italy, has been unfairly treated,
in that he was not for that reason deified, as the originator
of a new kind of fruit, because he pointed it out. Wherefore‚
if the universe has existed from the beginning, both equipped
and furnished with definite plans for carrying out its functions,
this reason for promoting humanity to divinity falls to the
ground, because the positions and powers that you have divided
amongst them existed as much from the beginning, as they
would also have existed, even if you had not appointed these
gods of yours. But you turn to another reason, and reply that
divinity was conferred upon them by way 01 rewarding their
deserts. And hence you grant, 1 suppose, that that god·
making deity excels in justice, since he apportioned so great
