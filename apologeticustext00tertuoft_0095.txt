APOLOGETICVS 21 71

so also that which has come forth from God, is God and the
Son of God, and both are one. So the Spirit that comes from
Spirit and the God that comes from God brought about the
number two, as regards the measure (of the possession of
being), in grade not in unchangeable condition, and it did
not separate from the source, but came out from it. This
ray, therefore, of God, as was always foretold1 in the past,
coming down into a certain virgin and being formed into flesh
in her womb, is born man mixed with God. The flesh having
been informed with breath is nourished, grows up, speaks,
teaches, works, and is Christ. Meantime accept this story,
which is like your own, while I show how he is proved to be
Christ and who they are among you who have previously
supplied hostile tales of that kind to destroy a truth of this
kind. The Jews too knew that Christ was to come, seeing that
it was to them that the prophets used to speak. For even now
they are looking out for his arrival, nor is there any greater
cause of disagreement between us and them than the fact that
they do not believe that he has already come. For as two
advents of his have been indicated, the first, which has already
been fulfilled (in every predicted detail), in the humility of his
human creation, the second, which precedes the end of the world,
in the loftiness of the manifested Godhead, they by misunder-
standing the first, have thought the second, which (having been
more clearly prophesied2) they expect, to be the only one. It
was the desert of their transgression that they should not under-
stand the original advent, for if they had understood, they would
have believed, and if they had believed they would have attained
safety. They themselves read it thus written, that they have
lost their wisdom and understanding and the use of their eyes
and ears. It followed therefore that he whom they had assumed
to be merely man because of his humility, they regarded as a
magician from his power, when by a word he cast out deinons
from men, restored light to the blind, cleansed the lepers,
braced up the paralytic again, and even by a word restored
the dead to life, ruled the elements themselves, quelling storms
and walking upon seas, showing that he was the word of God
(that is the Logos), that original, first-born word, attended
by power and reason and supported by spirit, the selfsaine
who was both making and had made everything by a word.
At his teaching, however, by which the teachers and leading
men among the Jews were refuted, they were so angered,
especially because a vast crowd was turning aside to him,
that in the end they prosecuted him, and by the violence of
