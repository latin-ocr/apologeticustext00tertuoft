public affairs, by death, at Sirmium on the seventeenth of March,
that most holy high-priest (01 Cybele) on the twenty-fourth 01
that same March, on which he made a libation 01 impure blood,
mutilating his arms also. none the less issued the usual orders
for the safety of the emperor Marcus, though his life was already
ended. Oh slothful messengersl Oh sleepy despatches! whose
fault it was that Cybele had no earlier news 01 the emperor's
demise, so as to prevent the ridicule 01 such a goddess by the
Christ-iaus. But even Jupiter would not immediately have
allowed his own Crete to be upset by the Romanffiasces, for-
getting the Idaean cave and the Corybantic cymbals and the
pleasing odour 01 his, nurse there. Would he not have preferred
his own grave there to any Capitol, so that the land which
covered the ashes 01 Jupiter should rather rule over the worle
Would Juno have wished that the Carthaginian city, ‘which she
loved next to Sanios‚⁷ should be destroyed by the race 01 the
sons 01 Aeneas (above all others) 2 To the best 01 my knowledge:

‘Here stood her chariot: here, if Heav’n were kind,
The seat 01 awful empire she design'd.'

The unhappy wife and sister of Jupiter could not prevail against
the fates! It is evident “’ Jupiter himself depends on destiny.’
Yet the Romans have not offered so much honour to the tates
which gave up Carthage to them against the will and prayer
01 Juno, as they have to the common whore Larentina. It is
certain that a number 01 your gods were kings. Therefore‚ 11
they have the power 01 conferring rule, from whom had they
received it, when they themselves reigned? XVhom had Saturn
and Jupiter worshipped? Some Sterculus, I suppose. But
what did the Romans do later with their native gods, even
if some did not reign? Yet the country was ruled by others,
not yet their worshippers, seeing they were not yet regarded
as gods. Consequently it is the prerogative 01 others to confer
a kingdom, because kingly rule existed much earlier than these
gods had their names engraved. But how 10011511 it is to
attribute the glory 01 the R'oman name to the deserts 01 piety‚
when your religion has developed since the time 01 the Empire
or even since the time of the kingdom! Come now, has the
growth 01 the state led to the advance 01 piety'? No: for
although Numa first formulated superstitious curiosity, never-
tlteless it was not till later that the divine clement among
thc- Romans consisted either 01 iinages or 01 temples: piety
was frugal and the ceremonies were inexpensive, and there was
no Capitol striving to reach the sky, but only improvised
altars made 01 turs, and vessels which were still 01 common
