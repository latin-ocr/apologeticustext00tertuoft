sentenced under them should be cut in pieces by their creditors,
yet was this cruelty afterwards blotted out by public consent,
the punishment 01 death being converted into a mark 01 dis-
grace. By the resort to a public sale of property they preferred
to raise the blush 01 5113100 1311101 11130 10 511001 blood. How
many laws still 110 hidden 101 you 10 purify, laws which neither
antiquity nor the dignity 01 111011 11310015, but only their 13110055
(11 such there be) commends? and therefore when they are
recognised to be 1101311, though condemning, they are deservedly
condemned. But how do we 0311 them 11013112 Nay, 11 they
punish the mere name, we 0311 111010 10011511 3150. If however
it is deeds that they punish, why, in our case, do they punish
deeds on the ground merely 01 1110 03100, which in other cases
they maintain must be proved by the 301 and not 11001 1110 03100
¹given to the accused'? I am guilty 01 100051; why do they not
inquire into it? 01 infanticide, why do they not extort 3 000-
10551002 Ι commit some 0110000 against the gods or the Caesars 3
why am I not heard, when I am able to clear myself? No law
forbids the investigation 01 11131 which is prohibited, because
neither 0311 any judge rightly exact punishment unless he
knows that an illegal 0110000 1135 been committed3 nor can any
citizen loyally obey the laW, 11 18001301 01 1110 0311110 01 11131
which is punished by the law. The law is not only bound to
satisfy 115011 35 10 115 own intrinsic justice, it must also satisfy
those 11010 whom it looks 101 obedience. A law excites suspicion
11 11 15 001 willing to be tested, and it is wicked 11, 31101 being
disapproved, it claims despotio power. V

CHAP. V. And now to 11031 somewhat more fully 01 1110
-011810 01 laws 01 11115 kind, there was an old decree that no
god should be consecrated by the emperor without the approval
01 1110 senate. M. Aemilius learnt this in the 0350 01 1115 god
Alburnus. This, 100, makes in our favour, because among you
divinity is weighed out by human caprice. Unless a god shall
have been acceptable to man, he shall not be a god: man must
now be propitious to a god. Accordingly Tiberius, in whose
time the Christian name first made its appearance in the world,
laid before the senate tidings from Syria Palaestina which had
revealed to him the truth 01 1110 divinity there manifested, and
supported the motion by his own vote to begin with. The
senate rejected it because it had not 115011 given its approval.
Caesar held to his own opinion and threatened danger to the
accusers 01 1110 Christians. Consult your records : you will there
find that Nero was the first emperor who wreaked his fury in
the blood 01 Christians, when our religion was just springing
