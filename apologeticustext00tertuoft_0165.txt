after to pay it down through an endless eternity. And there-
fore it is neither death at once, nor a recurring resurrection, but
we shall be the same as now, nor different afterwards3 wor-
shippers of God indeed and ever with God, clothed upon with
the special nature of eternity3 but the profane and those who
are not perfect before God, in the punishment of an equally
lasting fire, having from its very nature a supply, divine of
course, of im-perishable quality. The philosophers also know
the difference between a secret and a common fire. Thus that
which is for human use is far different from that which ministers
to the judgment of God, whether it draws down thunderbolts
from heaven, or belches fire from the earth through the
mountain craters3 for it consumes not what it burns, but
renews even while it destroys. Thus the mountains endure
though always burning, and he who is stricken with fire from
heaven is sate from being reduced to ashes by any other fire.
And this will be a witness of eterna] fire, this an example of
everlasting judgment, continually feeding its own punishment:
the mountains are burned and yet endure. What shall we say
of the guilty and of. the enemies of God?

CHAP. XLIX. These are the things which in us alone are
called vain assumptions, but in the philosophers and poets are
instances of the highest knowledge and of extraordinary ability.
They are wise, we are fooh'sh3 they are worthy of honour, we
of ridicule, nay more than that, of punishment too. Let the
opinions we hold be false and deserving of the name of prejudice,
but yet they are necessary ; let them be foolish, but yet they
are advantageous‚ since those who believe them are constrained
to become better men, from fear of everlasting punishment and
hope of everlasting refreshment.> Therefore it is inexpedient
that those things should be called false, or regarded as foolish,
which it is expedient should be presumed to be true, on no
ground whatever ought that to be condemned which is bene-
ficial. It is in you therefore that we find this very prejudice
which condemns the useful. Hence our belief cannot be foolish,
and, assuredly, even if it were false and foolish, it is nevertheless
injurious to no one; for it is like many other things on which
you inflict no penalties, unreal and fictitious things, which are not
prosecuted nor punished, as being harmless3 but indeed against
such errors judgment ought to be pronounced, if at all, by ridicule,
not by swords and fires and crosses and wild-beasts; in which
unjust cruelty not only this blind rabble exults and insults, but
certain of your own selves also, who aim at popularity with the
