word of cursing. Plato also did not deny the existence of
angels: even the magi are ready to bear witness to both names
(i.e. spirits and angels). Nay we learn in sacred literature the
story how, from certain angels polluted of their own free-will,
a yet more polluted race of spirits arose, condemned by God
along with the founders of their stock and along with him whom
we have called the chief. Now it will be enough to explain
the course of their work. Their business is the destruction of
man3 thus did the wickedness of spirits begin at the beginning
of things with a view to the ruin of man. Therefore while it
is true that they inflict on bodies both diseases and some severe
accidents‚ they also inflict on the soul sudden and strange
aberrations of violent madness. Their wonderful subtilty and
fineness of texture give them access to both parts of man.
Spiritual agencies have great power, so that being invisible and
intangible1 they show themselves rather in their effect than in
their acti0n3 if fruit, if ground-crops are through some secret
fault in the atmosphere nipt in the bud, killed in the seed,
seriously damaged when ripe, and if the air attacked in some
hidden way exhales its pestilential draughts. Then by the same
obscure contagion the breathing of daemons and of angels (upon
us) works corruptions of the mind also, in attacks of raving
madness and disgraceful paroxysms of folly or cruel lusts
attended by various errors, of which the most signal is this by
which it recommends these gods to the enthralled and deluded
minds of men, that it may obtain for itself also proper diets of
fumes and blood, offered to statues and images. And what
more exquisite pasture could it have than by its deceptive
legerdemain to turn away man from thinking on true divinityZ
How it works these very tricks I will explain. Every spirit is
winged. So are angels and daemons. Consequently in a moment
they are everywhere, to them the whole world is one place;
what is being done in any place it is as easy for them to know as
to report. Their swiftness is believed to betoken divinity, be-
cause their substance is unknown. Thus they sometimes wish
to be regarded as the authors also of what they report3 and
they certainly are so at times in the case of evil, but never of
good things. Even the counsels of God they in the old days
picked up from the words of the prophets, and in these days
they gather them from the lessons of Scripture they hear. So it
is that gleaning from them certain responses with regard to dates
they enviously ape the divinity, while they steal the oracles of
God. In the sphere of oracles, moreover, people like Croesus and
Pyrrhus know with what ingenuity they adapt ambiguities to
