TERTULLIAN'S DEFENCE OF THE CHRISTIANS
AGAINST THE HEATHEN

CHAP. I. If it is not permitted even to you, who are the

;picuous tribunal, which I might almost call the very summit 01
)111 51310; 11, I say, even you may not openly investigate and
udge in the presence 01 both parties, what are the real facts in

:ecently happened, the persecution 01 11115 5001, having been
300 11111011 exercised in trials connected with households, has
ilocked up the way to defence—, then let the truth be permitted

the laws, which are absolute masters in their own realm, 11 5110
should be heard? Or will this make them boast all the more 01
111011 power, in that they condemn the truth even when they
have heard it? Further, 11 they should condemn it unheard,
besides the odium attached to 11111311· dealing, they will also earn
the suspicion 01 3 00113111 complicity, by their refusal to hear
what, 11 heard, they could not condemn. This then is the first
proof that we lay before you 01 1110 injustice 01 your hatred
towards the name 01 Christian. This 1111131111055 15 31 01100
exaggerated and refuted by the same plea that seems to excuse
it, namely ignorance. For what could be more 11111311 111311 11131

hatred, when it is already ascertained whether it deserves it.
