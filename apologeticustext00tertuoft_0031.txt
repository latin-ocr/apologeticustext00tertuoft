against themselves, or ascribe to their destiny or their star the
outbursts 01 311 evil mind. For they are unwilling to acknow-

Christian does nothing 01 1116 kind. No (Christian) 16615 51131116,

0116. If he is defamed, he rejoices; 11 116 15 prosecuted, he does²
not defend himself, 11 116 15 questioned, he at once 6011165565,“
11 he is condemned, he returns thanks. What evil can there be
in this which has none 01 the characters of evil, either 1631,
01 51131116, prevarication, regret, or despair? What? is there evil
in that, which 6311565 pleasure to the person accused 01 11,
whose prosecution is his dearest wish, and who finds his
happiness in his punishment? You cannot call it madness,
since you are proved to know nothing about it.

CHAP. II. Again, supposing it to be true that we are
criminals 01 deepest dye, why are we treated differently by
you from our fellows, I mean all other criminals, since the same
guilt ought to meet with the same treatment? When others
are called by whatever name is applied to us, they employ both
their own voices and the services 01 3 paid pleader to set forth
their innocence. They have every opportunity 01 answering
and cross-questioning, since it is not even legal that persons
should be condemned entirely undefended and unheard. But
the Christians alone are not permitted to say anything to clear
themselves 01 the charge, to uphold the truth, to prevent in-
justice in the judge. The one thing looked 101 15 that whjeh
is demanded by the popular hatred, the confession 01 the name,
not the weighing 01 3 charge. Whereas, 11 you were inquiring
into the case 01 501116 61111111131, you would not be satisfied to ‘'
give a verdict, immediately on his confession 01 1116 6111116 01
homicide or sacrilege or incest or treason, 10 speak 01 the charges
levelled against us, unless you also demanded an account 01 1116
accessory facts, 1116 character 01 1116 361, 1116 frequency 01 115
repetition, the place, the manner, the time, who were privy to
it, who were accomplices in it. In our case no such procedure
is followed, although there was an equal necessity to 5111 by
investigation the false charges that are bandied about, how
many slaughtered babes each had already tasted, how many
times he had committed incest in the dark‚ what cooks, what
dogs had been present (on the occasion). Oh what 131116 would
that governor have acquired, 11 he had ferreted out some one,
who had already eaten up a hundred 1111311151 But we find
that in our case even such inquiry is forbidden. For Plinius
