CHAP. XXVIII. Since however it might easily seem unjust
that free men should be forced against their will to perform
sacrifice (101· at other times also a willing mind is enjoined 101
the performance 01 1011810110 duty), it would assuredly be thought
absurd, 11 any one were compelled by another 10 pay respect to
gods, whom he was bound to appease 101 1110 own sake without
any urging, lest it might at once be open to him to say by the
right 01 freedom: Ι (10 not want Jupiter to be propitious to
me: w ho are V 011. ‘Let J anus meet me with angry looks from
0111* 1000 110 likes3 11* hat business have you with me. 2 You were
110111οᾶ 01 0011100 by the same spirits to compel us to sacrifice 101
1110 safety 01 the emperor, and the necessity 101 coercion was
as much imposed on you as the obligation 01 incurring danger
by refusal was imposed on us. We have come then to the
second charge, that 01 injury done to a more sacred majesty,
since you worship the Caesar with greater dread and more
calculating 1001 than you do Olympian Jove himself. And
deservedly, 11 you only knew. For who among the living is
not better than any dead man you like? But even this is not
done by you 110111 reason, so much as from regard to authority
which acts on the spur 01 the moment3 to such a degree in this
matter also will you be found irreligious towards your gods, in
showing more dread 01 human power. Finally among you a
man will sooner commit perjury by all the gods than by the
one genius 01 Caesar.

CHAP. XXIX. First then let it be agreed, whether these to
whom sacrifice is offered can confer safety on the emperors or
on any other man, and then charge us with treason, 11 0118010
01 (1001110110, 111 00001100 most depraved, work any benefit, 11 the
lost save, 11 those that are condemned acquit, 11 finally, the
dead (such as ye know your gods to be) are guardians 01 the
living. Ι1 so, they would first at all events guard their own
statues and images and temples, which I believe the soldiers 01
1110 Caesars keep 0010 by night pickets. I think moreover
that the very materials 01 these come 110111 the mines 01 the
Caesars, and that the erection 01 whole temples depends on
the will 01 the Caesar. Further, many gods have experienced
the wrath 01 Caesar. It supports my 0000, 11 they have also
found him propitious, when he confers upon them some free
gift or privilege. HoVV then can they, who 010 111 the power 01
the Caesar, and VV 110 entirely belong to him, 11010 the safety 01
the Caesar ln their power, so as to appear able to grant {hat
(safety), Which they themselves VV ould 111010 easily gain from
the Caesar. 2 Therefore it is that we offend against the majesty
