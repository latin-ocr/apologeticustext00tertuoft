are sisters to ordinary vessels and tools, or are made from the
same vessels and tools, changing their destiny as it were by
dedication, the wantonness 01 art transforming them, and that
too in the most insulting way involving a sacrilege in the work
itself. Thus it may be in truth a solace especially to us who are
punished on account 01 the gods themselves, a solace, Ι say,
in our punishment, that they themselves also go through the
same experience 101· their making. You place the Christians
on crosses and stakes: what image is not first moulded in soft
clay laid on a cross and a stake? it is on a gibbet that the body
01 your god is consecrated first 01 all. You tear the sides 01
the Christians with claws, but upon your gods axes and planes
and files are more vigorously applied all over their bodies.
We lay down our necks: your gods are without a head until
lead and glue and nails have been applied. We are cast out
to wild-beasts, to the very beasts which form the train 01
Bacchus and Cybele and the Carthaginian goddess 01 Heaven.
We are cast into the fire: so also are they, while the ore from
which they are taken is refined. We are condemned to the
mines and quarries: it is from thence your gods get their origin.
We are banished to islands: in an island also it is usual for some
god 01 yours either to be born or to die. Ι1 any divinity is thus
confirmed, then those who are punished are deified‚ and punish- “
ments will have to be spoken 01 as tokens 01 divinity. But
clearly your gods do not 1001 these injuries and insults involved
in their formation, as neither do they feel the homage they
receive. Oh the impious words, the sacrilegious abuse! gnash
your teeth at them, and foam with ragel You are the same
people who blamed Seneca when with more bitterness and at
greater length he argued against your superstition. Conse-
quently, 11 we do not worship cold statues and figures, which
have a strong likeness to the dead they represent, images 01
which kites and mice and spiders have a correct idea, did not
the renouncing 01 a discovered error deserve praise rather than
punishment? For can we be thought to inflict injury on those
who, we 1001 sure, do not exist at all ’ἓ That which does not
exist, can suffer nothing from any one, because it has no
existence.

CHAP. XIII. ‘But 10 115 they are gods,’ you say. Ι1 that
be so, how is it that you on the contrary are found impious,
sacrilegious, and irreligious towards your gods? you who neglect
those whose existence you take 101· granted, who destroy those
whom you sear, who mock even those whom you avenge?
Consider 11 my statement 15 false. In the first place, when
