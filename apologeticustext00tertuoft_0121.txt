01 13116 emperors, because we do not subject them to their own
creatures, because we do not make sport of the duty of (praying
for) their safety, since we do not think that it lies in hands
soldered with lead. But you are the irreligious people, who seek
it where it is not, ask it of those who cannot give it, passing
over him in whose power it 13. Furthermore you persecute
1311036 who‘ know how 130 ask it, who can also obtain it, since
they know how to ask.

CHAP. XXX. For we invoke on behalf of the safety 01 1116
emperors a God who is everlasting, a God who 13 1661, 6 God
who is living, whom even 1116 emperors themselves prefer should
be propitious 10 1116111 beyond all others. They know who gave
them empire, they know, as human beings, who gave them life
also, they 1661 that he is the only God, in whose power alone
they are, to whom they are second, after whom they 616 first,
before all and above all gods. Why not? since they are above
all 111611, who 01 course are alive and take precedence 01 the dead.
They reflect how 161 1116 strength 01 111611 empire extends, and
thus they understand God3 they recognise that they are strong
through him, against whom they have no strength. Let the
emperor then subdue heaven, let him lead heaven captive 111
1113 triumph, let him set his watch, let him impose his
tribute on heaven. He cannot3 he is great for the reason
that he is only less than heaven. For he himself belongs to
Him whose are both heaven and all created things. He derives
his position 01 emperor from the same source from which
he derived his humanity before he became emperor. He gets
his power from the source from which he gets his breath.
Thither the Christians look up, with hands spread out because
innocent, with head uncovered, because we are not ashamed,
finally without a prompter, because we pray from the heart.
We pray always for all the emperors, that they may have a long
1116, 6 3616 11116, 6 family free from danger, courageous armies,
a faithful senate, loyal subjects, a peaceful world, all that a man
and a Caesar pray for. These things I cannot pray for from ·
any one else than from him from whom I know I shall get them,
since he himself alone 6611 give them, and I am he to whom the
obtaining is due, his slave, who alone worship him, who 011
account of his teaching am put to death, who offer him a rich
and greater victim than he himself commanded, prayer arising
from a pure body, from an innocent soul, from the Holy Spirit,
not grains 01 incense costing a penny, the tears 01 611 Arabian
tree, nor two drops 01 unmixed wine, nor the blood of an un-
sound OX,anxious for death,and after all these stains a conscience
