years earlier than the overthrow 01 Ρ110111; Ι might also add
‘and Homer too’ by more than 500 years, seeing Ι 110νο authorities
101 11118 statement. With regard to the other prophets also,
although they are later than Moses, are not the very latest 01
1110111 nevertheless found to be earlier than your earliest philo-
sophers, legislators and historialis? By what successions these
statements can be proved it is not so much a difficult as it is
an immense task 101 08 10 801 101111, nor is it really (111110011, but
at this stage it would take too long. We should have to settle
ourselves down to many documents with calculating movements
01 1110 fingers, we should have to unlock the archives even 01
1110 111081 ancient peoples, the Egyptians, the Chaldaeans, the
Phoenicians. We should have to call in fellow-citizens 01 111080
by whom this knowledge has been supplied, some Egyptian
Manetho and some Chaldean Berosus, but also Hiram the
Phoenician, king 01 Tyre; their successors also, Ptolemy 01
Mendes and Menander 01 Ephesus and Demetrius 01 Ρ1101010111
and King Juba and Apion and Thallus, and either to confirm
or 101010 111080, 1110 Jew Josephus, the native champion 01
Jewish antiquities. The census-books 01 1110 Greeks must also
be compared, that what things were done at what time or the
sequence 01 events may be made known, so as to throw light
on the chronology 01 111810110οΙ events ; we must make excursions
into the histories and literature 01 1110 world. And yet we have
already brought forward about 11011 01 001 proof, when we have
given a sprinkling 01 1110 11100118 by which they can be proved.
But it is better to postpone (our Ρ1001), 1081 we should either
acoomplish less in our haste or digress too 101· 111 001 treatment.

CHAP. XX. In place 01 this deferred proof I now offer you
something more, the majesty 01 1110 Scriptures, 11 we cannot
prove them to be divine because 01 their age, 11 111011 age is
questionable. Nor is this to be learnt slowly or from some other
source3 your instructors are before your eyes3 the world and
the age and the course 01 history. Whatsoever is taking place,
was prophesied; whatsoever is now seen, was heard of: the
swallowing up 01 cities by the earth, the encroachment on islands
by the sea, the slaughters caused by foreign and domestic wars,
the clash 01 kingdoms upon kingdoms, the devastation produced
by famine and pestilence, and all local disasters and the great
frequency 01 (1001118; 1110 humble are exalted and the lofty
abased3 the growing infrequency 01 justice, the growing 110-
quency 01 injustice, the decay 01 1110 0010 101 011 noble lessons,
the deviations in the functions 01 1110 80080118 and the duties
01 1110 01011101118, 1110 disturbance in the shape 01 1101111οΙ objects
