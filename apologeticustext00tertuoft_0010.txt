vi PREFACE

in, and to cut out references or quotations given twice in the
same note. I have brought the references to the works of
Tertullian that have appeared in the Vienna edition, into
conformity with that edition, as the Professor himself would
have wished. In the few cases where references have in some
way baffled me, I have placed a point of interrogation within
brackets as a danger signal. It is not often that I have added
anything of my own. When this has been done, I felt sure
that Prof. Mayor himself would have made the addition prior
to publication. Such additions are enclosed within square
brackets, and the editor’s initials are appended.

The notes were not intended by their author to constitute

They provide, ”hfweven so vast a body of illustration‚ both
of the subject-matter and of the language of the Apology, that
not only are they to be regarded as a commentary‚ but as by
far the best commentary ever published. Nevertheless, as
Tertullian is the most difficult of all Latin prose writers, and
the notes are not of a type intended for schoolboys, it has
been deemed advisable to add an English translation of the
text. This translation has had the inestimable advantage of
thorough revision by the veteran brother of the commentator,
Emeritus-Professor J oseph B. Mayor, of King’s College, London,
who-{iiis spared no pains to make the whole book as perfect as
posS1 e.

The Provost of King’s‚ Dr M. R. James, has given kind
help in cases of extreme difficulty. I am also indebted to my
assistant, Mr Robert Weir‚ formerly of Pembroke College,
Oxford. for help in the reading of the proofs and the verifi-
cation of references. Nor must I forget the extreme care of
the press readers.

Prof. Mayor’s introduction, with the notes on chapters I
to V, has been reprinted from The Journal of Philoloyy by kind
permission of the editors. I have ventured to add a biblio-
graphy of the chief works on Tertullian‚ which have appeared
since that article was published. I have also compiled the index,
