APOLOGETICVS 23 83

from these same gods of yours, who reveal not only this, that
neither they themselves nor any others are gods, you immedi-
ately learn this also, namely who is truly God, and whether it
is he and he alone whom we Christians profess to believe, and
whether he ought to be believed and worshipped as the belief
and teaching of the Christians is laid down. They will say at
the same time: ‘And who is that Christ with his story? was he
a man of ordinary condition? was he a magician? was he after
death stolen from the tomb by his disciples? Is he now at last
among the shades be10w2’ Is he not rather in the heavens, and
to come thence with a movement of the whole universe, with
trembling of the world, with mourning of all (but not of the
Christians), as the power of God and the breath and word and
wisdom and reason of God, and the Son of God? Whatsoever
you laugh at, let them also (i.e. the daemons) laugh at it with
youg let them deny that Christ will judge every soul that has
been since the beginning of time, each having its body restored
to it. Let them say that instead of this tribunal a Minos perhaps
and a Rhadamanthus, according to the agreement of Plato and
the poets, were allotted to this duty; let them at least
repudiate the· stigma 01 their own disgrace and condemnation.
They report that they are unclean spirits, a fact which ought
to have been understood even from their diet, blood and smoke
and the putrid sacrifices of cattle, and the polluted tongues of the
soothsayers themselves. Let them deny that on account of their
wickedness they were fore-ordained to the same day of judgment
with all their worshippers and agencies. Yet all this rule and
power of ours over them derives its strength from the naming
of Christ, and from the mention 01 those things which they look
for as impending over them from God, through Christ the Judge.
Fearing Christ in God and God in Christ, they are subject to the
serv ants of God and Christ. Thus from our touch and from our
breath being carried aw ay by the thought and Υ 131011 01 that fire,
