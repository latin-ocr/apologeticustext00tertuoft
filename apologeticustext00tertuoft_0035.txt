guilty from the confession 01 the name. But, niethinks, you
do not wish us to perish, though you believe us to be the worst
01 men. For is it your wont to say to a murderer, ‘Deny the

confession, as you know has to be condemned by you 01 110003-

He tells what he is3 you wish to hear what he is not. Though
presiding to extract the truth, 110111 113 310110 you strive to hear
falsehood. ‘I am,’ he says, ‘ that which you ask whether I am:
why do you torture me to make me give a wrong answer? You

that 1113101301013 should be rooted out, not concealed; they lay
down that those who 00111033 should be condemned, not ac-
quitted. This is ordained by decrees 01 the senate, by the edicts

rule 01 3 fellow-citizen, not 01 3 tyrant. For with tyrants
