APOLOGETICVS 46 129

they say, give the same advice and make the same professions,
uprightness, justice, endurance, sobriety‚ chastity. Why then
are we not similarly made equa] to them in the freedom and
impunity accorded to our teaching, if we are compared with
them in teaching? Or why are they also as our equals not
forced to perform duties, the non-performance of which by us
results in our trial? For who forces a philosopher to sacrifice,
or to swear, or to expose useless lamps at midday? Nay rather,
they both openly demolish your gods and they even blame your
superstitious in their writings, and you praise them for it. Very
many of them even bark at the emperors, while you submit to
it, and they are more readily rewarded with statues and salaries
than sentenced to the wild-beasts. And deservedly3 for they
are surnamed philosophers not Christians. This name philo-
sophers does not put daemons to fiight. Why should it be
otherwise, since philosophers consider that daemons come next
after the gods? It is a saying of Socrates: ‘If the daemon
permit.’ He also, when he showed something of true wisdom
in denying the gods, yet just at the close of his life ordered
a cock to be sacrificed to Aesculapius, I believe out of respect to
his father, because Apollo declared Socrates the wisest of men.
Oh ill-advised Apollo! He gave a testimonial for wisdom to
that man who denied the existence of the gods. With what-
soever vehemence truth is hated1, in that degree does he offend
who sets it forth as the result of his belief3 he however who
adulterates‚ while pretending love for it> gains favour most of all
on this account among the persecutors of the truth. Philosophers
affect the truth by mockery and corruption with hostile intent,
and by imitation corrupt it like those who snatch at praise,
Christians both seek after the truth of necessity and display
it in its purity, like those who care for their own salvation.
So neither in knowledge nor in morality are we on a level, as
you suppose. For what certainty was there in the reply which
Thales, the first of natural philosopherS‚ made to Croesus when
he questioned him with regard to divinity, although he had
often employed to no purpose the extension of time allowed him
for deliberation? But any Christian labourer both finds and
sets fort-h God and then ascribes to him in deed all that is sought
for in God, although Plato asserts that the maker of the universe
is not easily found and when found is with difficulty explained
to the multitude. Moreover if we make our appeal on the
point of chastity, I read that a part of the Athenian sentence
was pronounced2 against Socrates as a corrupter of youth.
