103111 110111 literature, neither the Greek Diodorus nor Thallus
nor Cassius Severus nor Cornelius Nepos, nor any other recorder
01 511011 ancient beliefs, has proclaimed him anything but a 111311,
11 10 proofs from facts, Ι find nowhere more reliable proofs than
in Italy 115011, 111 which Saturn after many expeditioris and 31101
3 1051(101100 111 Α11103 took up his abode, having been welcomed
by Janus, or ι131105, 35 1110 Salii prefer to 0311 him. The moun-
tain which he had inhabited was called Saturnian, the city, the
bounds 01 which he had marked out with stakes, is even to this
day Saturnia, finally the whole 01 Italy was named Saturnian,
in succession to the name Oenotria. With him it was that
accounts began and the impress 01 3 1111111311 figure upon a coin,
and thus it is that he presides over the treasury. But 11 Saturn
was a 111311, 110 was 01 0011150 sprung from 3 111311, and because
he was sprung from a man, it follows that he did not come from
heaven or earth. But when a man’s parents were unknown, it
was easy to 0311 him a son 01 111050 whose sons we also can all
01 115 be considered3 101 who would not 0311 heaven and earth
father and mother respectively out 01 reverence and respect?
even in accordance with human custom, by which unknown
persons or those who appear unexpectedly are said to have
come upon us 110111 heaven. Thus it is that Saturn who appeared
suddenly happened everywhere to be called divine3 indeed the
common people 0311 those also ‘sons 01 earth' whose origin is
uncertain. I say nothing 01 1110 1301 11131 1111 111011 111011 were
so unsophisticated, that they were stirred by the appearance
01 any new man, as 11 it were divine, since to—day men who are
already cultivated deify those who a few days before they
confessed by a public funeral were dead. Enough now about
Saturn, though in few words. We will show that even Jupiter
was himself as much man as he was sprung 110111 111311, and that
in succession the whole swarm 01 1115 descendants were as morta]
as they were like the seed 110111 which they sprang.

CHAP. XI. And since you have established the custom 01 ⁷
maintaining that they were deified 31101 death, in spite 01 1110
1301 that you dare not deny them 10 113νο 100011 111011, 101 115
review the causes that have led to this result. In the first
place 01 0011150, you must admit that there is some superior
god, a sort 01 proprietor 01 deity, who has made gods out 01
men. For neither could they have taken to themselves a
deity which they did not posseSS, nor could anyone else have
offered it to those who did not possess it unless he possessed it
in hjs own right. Ι1 there was no one to make them gods, it is
in vain that you assume their deification 10 113νο taken place,
