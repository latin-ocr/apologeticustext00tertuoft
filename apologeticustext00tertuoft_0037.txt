pulsion? or whether one who has been forced to deny should
not have denied sincerely‚ and after acquittal on the spot,
leaving the court, should once more claim to be a Christian,
and laugh at your vain effort to prove him other? Since there-
1010111 every way you treat us differently from all other criminals,
by aiming at this one thing, that we may be shut out from that
name, 101 we are shut out 11 we do things which Christians do
not do, you can understand that there is no crime in question,
but just the name, which 18 harassed by the scheming 01 3 kind
01 rival agency, its first aim being that men should be unwilling
to know for certain that 01 which they certainly know them-
selves to be ignorant. Consequently they not only believe what
is not proved with regard to us, but they are unwilling that
inquiry should be made, lest those things should be proved not
to be, which they had rather should be believed to be, so that
the hostile name 01 that rival agency should be condemned
merely by its own confession, on the presumption, not the proof
01 0111110. Accordingly we are tortured when we 00111088, and ,ε’
punished when we persist‚ and acquitted if we deny, just.¹¹
because it is a battle about a name. Finally, you also read}
out 110111 1110 charge-sheet that a man is a Christian. Why not·
also style him a murderer? If a Christian is a murderer, why
not also one guilty 01 1110081 or any other crime you believe us
to be guilty of? It is in our case only that you are ashamed or
reluctant to give a verdict on the mere names 01 the crimesl.
If a Christian is guilty of no specific crime, it is a very guilty
sort 01 0111110, 11 0110 01 the name only!

CHAP. ΙΙΙ. Again‚ many people are so blinded with pre-
judice that even when they are bearing witness to a man’s
excellence, they mingle with it a taunt against the name 01
Christian. ‘So-and-so is a good sellom were it not that he is
a Christian.’ So another says ίΙ marvel that a philosopher like
So-and-so should have so suddenly turned Christian.' No one
reflects whether the fact that So-and-so is good or wise is due to
his Christianity, 01 the fact that So-and-so is a Christian results
110111 his being wise and good. They praise what they know,
and blame what they do not know, and that which they know
they spoil because they are really ignorant 01 it. Surely
it were a juster course to prejudge things hidden 110111 things
evident, than to precondemn the evident 110111 the hidden.
Others characterize in their very praises those they formerly
knew, before they received the name 01 Christian, as vagabonds,
worthless and wicked. Through their blind hatred they become
