centuries. Thus: Henri Goelzer, ‘Etude lexicographique et
grammaticale de la Latinite de Saint J erome' (Paris, Hachette,
1884), and (a perfect model in its way) Max Bonnet, ‘Le Latin
de Gregoire de Tours’ (ibid. 1890). The Archiv fiir lat.
Lexikographie‚ published since 1884 by Teubner, has, thanks 130
the sels-sacrifice of the publisher and the editor Ed. Wolffiin‚
done a great work in surveying the whole field of Latin letters,
and training readers 130 gather in the whole mass of Latin words.
There too may be seen reviews of all new books and articles
bearing 011 13110 subject.

There is yet an opening for two lexicons, of moderate
compass, but of great value to critics, lexicographers and
grammarians.

(A) We possess two lexicons of terminations in Greek, but,
to my knowledge, none in Latin. [The want was supplied in
1904 by Ο. Gradenwitz‚ Later uli Vocum Latinarum: Voces
Latinas et a fronte et a tergo ordinandas curauit (Leipzig). A. S.]

dictionarium analogicum linguae graecae’ (Cambr. typis acad.
1800. 4ῖο), 3 book recommended by the late Dr Thompsong
and (II) ‘Etymologisches Worterbuch der griechischen Sprache
zur Uebersicht der Wortbildung nach den Endsylben geordnet
von Dr Wilhelm Pape' (Berl. 1836, Svo).

(Β) Faber and Gesner frequently record under one word
other words with which it is liable to be confounded by scribes;
they also cite lexicographical collections in commentaries and
joumals. Whoever has traced with attention the course of
lexicography knows that almost every word well treated by any
lexicon owes its good fortune to some exhaustive note of N.
Heius, or J. F. GronOV, or Bentley cet. The indexes to such
books as Drakenborch's Livy and Duker’s Florus will shew how
the thing should be done. To go down the whole course of
classical learning, from such treasuries as Gruter's ‘Fax
Artium,³ to the ‘aduersaria' of Madvig and the ‘lectiones’ of
Cobet, would be the making of any young scholar.

The most useful commentaryg on the whole, is Oehler's.
Herauld also and Rigault should be read, and Dr Pusey. La
Cerda is copious in parallels. Pamelius takes a polemical
