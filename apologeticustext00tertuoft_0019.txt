INTRODUCTION xv

after this! How do we put them away as childish things, and feel
ashamed that we should set such value on the vituperative filth
which is poured forth upon Aeschines and Antony, political rivals
on the narrow stage of a corner of this little world.

I believe that 01 those who have really grappled with
Tertullian’s difficulties, few will challenge this verdict 01 a
most competent judge.

I can conceive few more valuable aids to classical scholar-
shjp than a digest, not on the plan of the Dutch uariorum
editors, nor yet on the scissors-and-paste plan 01 Dindorf, 01
all that is permanently valuable in commentaries and miscel-
laneous remarks on the Christian apologists, say to 500 A.D.
The work should appear by itself, and would have a permanent
value, whatever manuscripts might spring to light. Critics and
commentators should be read in order 01 time and each allowed
credit for his contributions—I would not ruthlessly clip away
even the biographical confidences with which old scholars en-

some one note, and cross references given. The editor would
be in excellent company 101 some years, and would learn some-

Kaye and Blunt1 and Pusey2‚ Neander and Oehler (sic) and
Bohringer and Noldechen3. Perhaps no two men ever more
thoroughly mastered every detail in the field of. the early apolo-

1 Right Use of the Early Fathers. Herc p. 432 Lightfoot might have
found, cited from Theoph. ad Autol. 1 l 1., a far more apt parallel to Philem. ll,
than that which he cites from c. 12 01 the same book.

² Notas (ascribed by Kaye to Dodgson) on Dodgson’s excellent translation
in the Library 01 the Fathers. It is interesting to learn that the citations
in these notes were verified by one who left us, J. B. Morris.

unrivalled excellence, is continued by his J ena colleagues.
