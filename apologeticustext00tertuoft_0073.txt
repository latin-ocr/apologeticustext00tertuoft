old gods are no nobler, yet they will consider it an insult paid
to them from you, that this privilege, which antiquity con-
ferred on them alone, has been allowed to others also.

CHAP. XIV. Ι am unwilling1 to go further and review your
sacred rites. Ι do not say what is your method in sacrificing,
which leads you to slaughter every worn-out, putrefying and
mangy creature, to cut off all the useless parts from the prime and
sound beasts, the little heads and the hoofs, which even at home
you would have set apart for slaves or dogs, your placing on
Hercules' altar of not even a third part of the tithe that is due
to him. I will rather praise your wisdom in rescuing something
of what is in danger of being lost. But when I turn to your
literature, whence you derive instruction in practical wisdom,
and the duties of gentlemen, what ridiculous situations do I
find! gods engaged like pairs of gladiators and fighting des-
perately together on account of the Trojans and the Achaeans,
Venus wounded by an arrow from a human hand, because she
wished to snatch her son Aeneas, when almost killed, from the
sanie Diomede (who had wounded herself) 3 Mars reduced almost
to a shadow by thirteen months in chains, Jupiter rescued by
the agency of some monster froin meeting the same violence at
the hands of the other divinities, and at one time weeping the
misfortune of Sarpedon, at another burning with shameful lust
for his sister, and telling her the while of the mistresses in the
long past, none of them so much loved as she. Since that time
what poet may not be found calumniating the gods, on the
authority of the chief of his craft? One makes over Apollo to
king Admetus to feed his flocks, another lets out Neptune’s
services in building to Laomedon. There is also the great lyric
poet (I mean Pindar), who sings that Aesculapius was deservedly
punished with a thunderbolt by reason of his greed, which made
him practise the healing art injuriously. Jupiter is evil, if
the thunderbolt is his, devoid of natural feeling for his grandson,
and jealous of the skilled practitioner. Such stories ought
never to have been revealed if trueg if false, ought never to
have been invented, among really religious people. Nor do the
writers of tragedies or comedies refrain from publishing in their
prologues the sorrows or wanderings of the family of some god.
Ι say nothing of the philosophers, being quite content with
Socrates, who, in mockery of the gods, swore by the oak and
the goat and the dog. But (say you) Socrates was condemned
for that very reason, because he tried to do away with the gods.
