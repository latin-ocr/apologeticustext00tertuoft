APOLOGETICVS 14, 15 51

Plainly! because the truth has long, or rather always, been an
object of hatred. Nevertheless, when the Athenians, from
remorse 101 the sentence they had passed, not only afterwards
punished the prosecutors 01 Socrates but also placed a golden
statue of him in a temple, the reversal 01 the condemnation
gave a new testimony to Socrates. But Diogenes too made
some witticism at Hercules’ expense, and the Roman Cynic,
Varro, introduces a whole host 01 headless Joves (or Jupiters
as they ought perhaps to be called).

CHAP. XV. The rest 01 your licentious wits also work 101
§our pleasures through the dishonour 01 the gods. Examine
the 131005 01 the Lentuli and Hostilii, and consider whether it is
the buffoons or your gods whose jokes and tricks you are laughing
at; such subjects as an adulterous Anubis, a masculine Moon‚
Diana 500018οᾶ, the will of the deceased Jupiter read aloud,
and three starving Herculeses held up to ridicule. Moreover
the writings 01 1110 playwrights also give form to all their
filthiness. The Suri-god mourns his son cast 11001 heaven, while
you rejoice, and Cybele sighs 101 her disdainful shepherd, while
you are no whit ashamed, and you 0311 endure to listen to the
song which tells the sins 01 Jupiter, and the trial 01 Juno,
Venus and Minerva by the shepherd. What 01 the fact that
a mask representing a god 01 yours covers the head 01 3 branded
and notorious person, that an unclean body prolonged 101 this
accomplishment by emasculation represents a Minerva or a
Hercules—is not their majesty outraged and their divinity
prostituted, while you applaud? You are clearly more religious
in the amphitheatre, where your gods in like manner dance on
human blood, on the marks 01 punishments undergone, pro-
viding plots and narratives 101 criminals, save and except that
criminals often put on the character 01 your gods themselves
also. We have sometimes witnessed the mutilation 01 Attis,
the famous god 01 Ρο551005, and a man who was burning alive
had personated Hercules. We have laughed too amidst the
sportive atrocities 01 the midday combatants, at Mel-cury testing
apparent deaths with a branding-iron; we have likewise seen
Jupiter’s brother dragging down the corpses 01 gladiators with
a hammer in his hand (to finish those who were not quite dead).
But who could even inquire into these absurdities one by 00οἶἰ
If they disquiet the honour 01 1110 gods, 11 they obliterate all
traces 01 divinity, surely they take their rise in the contempt
both 01 those who practise such things and 01 those 101 whom
they practise them. But those you will say are mere shows.
