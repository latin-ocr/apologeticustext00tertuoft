APOLOGETICVS 39 115

01 friends, but also most patiently supply their own to their
friends, in accordance, I believe, with the well-known teaching
01 ancient sages and philosophers, the Greek Socrates and the
Roman Cato, who shared their wives with friends, those wives
whom they had married. perhaps with their consent, to bear
children in other households also. For what care could they
have 101 chastity, which their husbands had given away so
lightly! What an example 01 Athenian philosophy, 01 Roman
seriousness! A philosopher and a censor both acting the part
01 procurers! What, wonder is it then that so great affection is
outraged! For you also revile our little dinners as extravagant
also in addition to being disgraced by crime. It was about us 01
0011150 that Diogenes uttered his saying: ‘The Megarians buy
food as 11 they were to die to-morrow, but they build as 11 they

were never to die 1 ’ But one sees a mote more easily in another’s '

eye than a beam in one’s own. The air becomes sour with so
many tribes, parishes and guilds belching. The Salii will need
a money-lender when they are to dine: the public accountants
will sum up the expenditure 01 the tithes and offerings to
Hercules ς at the Apaturia, the Dionysia, and the Attic mysteries
a levy 01 cooks is proclaimed, at the smoke 01 3 Sarapis banquet
the firemen will be aroused. It is only the dining-room 01 the
Christians that is objected to. Our dinner shows its significance
by its name : it is called by the name which amongst the Greeks
means affection. VVhatsoever be its cost, it is a gain to incur
expense in the name of religion, since by this refreshment we
help those 11110 are in need, not in the 11 ay that among you

If the purpose 01 our entertainment is honourable, form your
estimate 01 the remainder 01 0111 11110 110111 its motiye. As it is
concerned with our religious duty, it allows nothing base,
nothing disorderly. We do not recline until we have first
partaken 01 prayer to Godg only so much is eaten as to satisfy
