APOLOGETICVS 21, 22 75

But we will show you that the very persons whom you worship
are reliable witnesses 01 Christ. lt is a great point, 11, 10 make
you believe the Christians, Ι 0311 employ those on whose account
you now disbelieve them. Meantime this is the order 01 0111
teaching, this the beginning both 01 0111 sect and name together
with that 01 115 founder. Let no 0116 now charge us with
dishonour, let no one believe any other thing than this, because
it is not permitted to any one to 1611 1165 3100111 1115 own religion.
For from the moment that a 111311 says anything is worshipped
by him other than what he worships, he denies what he worships,
and transfers both worship and honour 10 another, and by
transferring he now no longer worships that which he denied.

We affirm and affirm openly and, torn and bleeding, as we are, ⁷

under your torture, we cry aloud, ‘We worship God through
Christ? Suppose him 10 be a man: it is through him and in ÷
him that God desires himself to be known and worshipped. But
to reply 10 1116 Jews, they themselves too were taught to worship ..
the Lord through the man Moses: and 10 111661 1116 objections
01 1116 Greeks, Orpheus at Pieria, Musaeus at Athens, Melampus
31 Argos, Trophonius in Boeotia bound men by initiations: to
turn my attention to you also, the rulers 01 1116 113110115, Numa
Pompilius, who loaded the Romans with most irksome super-
stitions, was a man. Let it be allowed to Christ to imagine
divinity to be his own possession, not as a mere name by which
he was to tone down to a true humanity a barbarous herd, by
making them awe-struck at the crowd 01 50 many divine powers
that had to be appeased, as Numa did, but so as to open to the
recognition 01 1116 1111111 the eyes 01 111611 already refined and
deceived by their very refinement. Seek then and see whether
this divinity 01 Christ be true. Ι1 11 15 11131 011 1116 learning
01 which any one is reformed and becomes good, it follows that
the unreal (divinity) must be given up, as all that method in
particular has been found out, which hiding itself under names
and representations 01 dead persons does by certain signs and
wonders and oracles work belief in its own divinity.

CHAP. XXII. And further we say that there are certain
spiritual substances3 nor is the name unusual. The philosophers
are familiar with daemons, since Socrates himself waited on the
will 01 3 daemon. Why not? A daemon is said to have
actually attached itself 10 111111 511106 boyhood, evidently to
dissuade him 110111 good. All the poets know them, even 1116
untaught rabble makes constant use 01 1116111 101 cursing; 101
they utter even the name 01 831311, 1116 chief 01 11115 evil class,
