CHAP. XXXIII. But 3371137 should I say more about the
religious attitude and the 1037111137 01 1110 Christians towards the
emperor? We are bound to look up to him as the one whom
our Lord has chosen. I should be justified in saying: the
Caesar 13 1110Γο ours (than 3701113), as having been appointed by
our God. Accordingly, as he 13 mine, I work more 101 1113 3010137,
31000 Ι 1101 only ask it 11001 Him who 13 ableto grant it, or
because I who ask it am such an one as deserves to obtain it,
but also because by lowering the greatness 01 1110 Caesar as
compared with that 01 God, I commend him 1110 more 10 God,
10 whom alone I subject him. But I subject him 10 Η101, 10
whom I do not make him equal. For I will not 0011 the emperor
G0d‚ whether it 13 because Ι 0111 unable to 110, or 337110111οΓ Ι do
not dare to mock him, or because he himself will not even wish
to be called God. Ι1 110 be a man, it 13 man's interest 10 yield
to God3 let him be content to be styled emperor. This also is
a great name, bestowed upon him by God. He who 00113 1110
Caesar God, denies him 10 1)0 what he is, an emperor; unless
he be a man, he 13 001 emperor. That he is a man he is reminded
even when he is riding in his triumpha] chariot. For a hint
comes 10 him from the rear: ‘Look behind you! Remember
that you are a man !' And surely he is all the more carried away
by the thought 01 1113 resplendent glory‚ that a reminder 01 1113
101 13 necessary to him. He were smaller (than he 13), 11 110
were then called God, because he would not be truly so called.
He who is recalled to himself lest he should think himself
God, is the greater.

CHAP. XXXIV. Augustus, the creator 01 1110 empire,
refused even to be called Lord: for this too 13 0 surname 01
God. Of course I shall call the emperor lord, but with the
usual spelling, and only when Ι 0111 001 forced to call him Lord
with a capital, in place 01 God. But I am free so 1οΓ 03 110 13
concerned3 1οΓ Ι 110370 10111 one Master, the almighty and eternal
God, the same who is also his God. How can he who is father
01 1113 native city be its lord? Moreover, the name which
suggests affectionatecare is more pleasing than that which
suggests authority. Even of 0 household 111011 are called fathers
rather than lords. So 1οΓ 13 11 from being a right 01 1110 emperor
to be called God, which is incredible [except] by a flat-tery 11101
