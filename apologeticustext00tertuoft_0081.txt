CHAP XV Π. The object of our xx 015111Ρ 15 000 God, who
through the word by xx hich he commanded (that thev should
exist), the reason by xxhich he arianged them, the Ρο11 01 bx
Which he could (031117 out his 11111), fashioned out 01 nothing all
thjs mass with all its apparatus of elements, bodies and spirits,
for an ornament to his own greatness, 11 hence it is that the
Greeks 3150 113170 applied the name κόσμος (ornament) to the
universe He 15 invisible, though he may be 500ος 100001Ρ10-
hensible, though he 15 represented to men through his grace3
inestimable, though he can be estimated through the human
senses3 therefore 1s he the true and the mighty God. What 15
capable, however, of being generally seen, of being grasped, of
being valued, is less both than the eyes by which it 15 caught,

recognise him of whom they 0300015 be ignorant. Do x ou wish
that 11*0 should prove this from his own Oworks, so many and of
such 3 character, by which 11*0 310 restrained, upheld, delighted;
nay even by 11 111011 we are terrified, or should 110 prove it even

by the prison of the body, though confined by evil customs,

after sleep, as after some illness, when it becomes 0005010115 of its
own health, it names God, for the sole reason that he alone is
by nature the true God. ⁶ Good God,' ⁴ Great God ’ and ‘Which
may God grant’ are expressions used by all. That he is also a
judge is attested by the words: ‘God sees,’ ‘I commend to
God,' and ‘God will recompense 1110.’ Ο evidence of the
natural Christianity of the 501111 For when uttering these
words it looks not to the Capitol, but to the sky. It knows
indeed the place of abode of the living Goel, from him and
