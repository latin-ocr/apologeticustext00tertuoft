pottery, and the'sacrificial odour from them, and the god him—
self—nowhere to be seen. For at that time the talents of
the Greeks and Etruscans had not yet flooded the capital 10
execute commissions for statues. ⁴ Consequently the Romans
were not religious before they were great, and therefore their
religion was not the cause of their greatness. Further, how
0011 11 110 011 account of religion that they are great, seeing it
was the want of religion which made them great? For unless
I am mistaken, every kingdom or empire is gained by wars and
extended by victories. Agatur, wars and victories are generally
at the eost of the capture and destruction 01 cities. That
business cannot be carried out without 1101111 10 gods. Walls
and temples are involved in common ruin, citizens and priests
are alike slaughtered, and there is no difference in the plundering
of sacred and profane wealth. ·Therefore the sacrilegious acts
of the Romans are as many in number as their trophies3 they
have triumphed as often over gods as over nations, their spoils
in war are no more numerous than the images of captive gods
that still remain. They therefore endure to be worshipped
even by their 0110111103, and they decree an empire without end
to those whose injuries‚ rather than their acts 01 11013111111, they
should have repaid. But those who are without feeling, it is
as harmless to injure, 03 11 13 idle to worship. Certainly it is
beyond belief, that those should have progressed on account of
their religious merits‚ who, 03 we have hinted‚ have either grown
by injury done to religion or have 11111101οᾶ injury on religion
by their growth. Even those whose kingdoms have been 00111-
11111οᾶ 10 make up the sum of the Roman Empire, were 1101 with-
out religions at the time when they lost their kingdoms.

CHAP. XXVI. See therefore, whether it is not he who
regulates kingdoms, whose is both the world that is ruled, and
the man himself that rules; whether it is not he that fixed the
alternations of power at their actual dates in the world’s history,
who was before all time and made the history 01 1110 world the
embodiment 01 time and seasons3 whether it is not he who
raises or crushes states, under whom the race 01 111011 existed at
one time without states. Why are you led astray'? Rome in
her rude state is older than certain 01 113 gods, it ruled before it
raised such a wide circuit as the Capitol. The Babylonians 100
had reigned before the 1101111113, 011(1 1110 Μοᾶ03 before the
Quindecimviri, and the Egyptians before the Salii, the Assyrians
before the Luperci, the Amazons before the Vesta] Virgins.
Finally, if it is the religious rites of Rome that confer kingdoms.
