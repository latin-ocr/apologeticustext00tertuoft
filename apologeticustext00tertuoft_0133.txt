APOLOGETICVS 37 109

upon you 101 injuries inflicted on us who are so united and so
stout-hearted even to death, when even a single night with
a few little t-orches could effect abundant vengeance, 11 11 were
allowable amongst us to wipe out wrong with wrong? But
a truce to the thought that a sect actuated by the spirit 01
God should either be avenged by the torch 01 111311 01 should
shrink from suffering that by which it is tested. For 11 we
wished to play the part also 01 declared enemies, and not merely
that 01 secret avengers, should we lack the force 01 numbers
and 01 troops 2 The Moors and the Marcomani and the Parthians
themselves, or any races 01 whatsoever size, which are limited
nevertheless to one place and to their own territory, are I suppose
more numerous than 116 are whose region is coextensive with
the whole world! We are but 01 yesterday, yet we have filled
all that 1s yours, cities, islands, fortified towns, country tow ns,
centres 01 meeting, even camps, tribes, classes 01 public 311611-
dants, the palace, the senate, the foruni3 we have 1611 you only
your temples. For what war should we not have been fitted
and ready, even 11 we had been unequal in forces, we, who are
so willing to be butchered, 11 11 had not been more permissible
according to this teaching 01 ours to be slain than to slay? We
could also, unarmed, and not rebellious but merely disagreeing,
have fought against you, using only the weapon 01 1116 ill-will
which our separation creates. For 11 such a mass 01 111611 as
we are had broken off from you and gone to some distant corner
01 1116 world, the loss 01 so many citizens, 01 whatever sort,
would assuredly have shamed your rule, nay rather would have
punished it even by the very fact 01 its desertion. Without
doubt you would have been panio-stricken at your solitude,
at the silence 01 business and the death-like stupefaction 01
1116 world3 you would have had to seek subjects to rule over.
More enemies would have remained to you than subjects. Now
as a matter 01 1301 you have few er enemies, in consequence 01
1116 multitude 01 the Christians, owing to the 1301 11131 nearly
all the citizens you have ln nearly 311 1116 cities are Christian.
But you have chosen to call them enemies 01 1116 human race
rather than 01 1111111311 61101. Moreover, 11110 would have
snatched you from those secret enemies that everywhere play
havoc with your minds and health? I mean from the incursions
of spirits, which we drive from you, without reward and without
price. This alone would have been sufficient 101 0111 vengeance,
that an empty tenement was then left open to unclean spirits.
Further, without even a thought 01 1116 compensation required
for so great a protection, you have preferred to consider as
enemies a class which is not only harmless to you, but even
