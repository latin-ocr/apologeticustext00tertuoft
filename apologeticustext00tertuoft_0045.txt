up in Rome. But we even glory in being first dedicated to
destruction by such a monster. For whoever knows him 0311
understand that it could only have been something 01 supreme
excellence that could have called forth the condemnation 01
Nero. Domitian too had tried the same experiment as Nero,
with a large share 01 Νο10“’0 cruelty, but inasmuch as he retained
something 01 humanity also, he was easily able to change his
course, even restoring those whom 110 had banished. Such have
always been our persecutors, unjust, impious and treacherous‚
whom even ye yourselves have been wont to condemn and to
reinstate those who were condemned by them. But out 01 so
many emperors who reigned 110111 11131 111110 10 1110 present, men
versed in knowledge, human and divine, show us one who set
himself to destroy the Christians. We on the other hand can

them alone. 7, Laws which Trajan made 1000 effective by 101-
bidding Christians to be sought out; to which no Hadrian,
although an investigator 01 311 curiosities‚ no V espasian,
although conqueror 01 1110 Jews, no Pius, no Verus ever set
his mark. Certainly the worst 01 111011 would be more readily
sentenced to death by all the best, as their enemies, than by
their own accomplices. s

CHAP. VI. Now Ι should like these scrupulous champions
and avengers 01 laws and ancestral institutions to answer with
regard to their own loyalty, respect and obedience towards the
decrees 01 their ancestors, whether they have abandoned none,
whether they have transgressed in none, whether they have
not abolished what were the necessary and most appropriate
elements 01 their rule 01 life. What has become 01 111000 laws
which checked extravagance and ostentationZ those which
ordered that not more than a hundred pence should be allowed
for a dinner, that not more than one fowl and that not specially
