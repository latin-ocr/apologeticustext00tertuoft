But neither did Tuscany nor Campania even in those days com-
plain about the Christians when fire 110111 heaven flooded
Vulsinii, and 1116 110111 113 own mountain Pompeii. No one
as yet worshipped the true God at Rome, when Hannibal by
means 01 1116 Roman rings measured by bushel the extent 01
1116 slaughter he had inflicted at Cannae. All your gods were
worshipped by all, when the Senones had seized the Capitol
113611. And fortunately any 11113101111116 11131 happened to cities
involved temples in the 331116 disasters as the city walls, which
enables 1116 now to prove that such disasters do not come from
the gods, because they come upon themselves also. The human
race has always descrved ill 01 God: in the first place indeed
as neglecting its duty towards him, whom though it understood
partly, it did not search out, but also devised 101 113611 011161
deities besides to worship: in the second place because, by not
secking out the teacher 01 uprightness and judge and avenger
01 guilt, it has grown in all vices and crimes. But 11 11 had
sought him out, it would have followed that, when it had
sought him, it might learn to know him, and when it recognised
him it might worship him, and when it had worshipped him
it might find him by experience to be propitious rather than
wrathful. Therefore we ought now also to know that the same
god is angry, as always in the past 3130, before Christians
received their name. Seeing that it enjoyed his blessings, which
were displayed before it fashioned gods for 113611, why should
it not understand that evils also come 110111 him, to whom it
was not conscious that the blessings belonged? It is guilty 01
that towards which it is also ungrateful. And yet 11 we were
to compare the disasters 01 old, those 01 1116 present day are
slighter, since God gave the Christians as his gift to the world.
