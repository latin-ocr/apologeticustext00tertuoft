the biblical account of the trial and the Passion3 is it not

his character for justice? Lardner says (p. 611) “when he wrote
to Tiberius, he <Pilate> would be very naturally led to say

in ignorance of the resurrection. The Gospel of Peter supports
indeed Lardner's surmise. For writers of legends had no feeling
for the tragic irony of history. The greatest event of human
story passed unnoticed by the rulers of earth, ‘not with obser-

reported executions of Christians to head quarters, we need but
turn to Plin. ep. X 96 §3 perseuerantes duci iussi.
