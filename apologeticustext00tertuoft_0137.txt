APOLOGETICVS '39 113

our belief on holy words, we 13100 0111 hope, we strengthen our
confidence, we clinch the teaching none the less by driving
home precepts. There too are pronounced exhortations, 001100-
110110 3οᾶ godly judgments. For our judgment too is delivered
with great weight, as among those who are sure that they are
acting under the eye 01 God, and there is the greatest anticipa-
tion 01 1110 11111110 judginent, 11 any one has so sinned, 30 10 00
03111011οᾶ 110111 1110 0011111111111011 01 prayer and assembly and all
holy fellowship. We are governed by the most approved elders‚
who have obtained this office not by purchase, but 011 testimony ;
101 indeed nothing 01 God 10 00131113010 by money. Even 11
we have a kind 01 treasury, this 10 1101 filled up 110111 3 001100 01
00118311011, 30 01 3 hired religion. Each member adds a small
sum once a month, 01 when he pleases, and only 11 110 10 willing
and able3 101 110 0110 10 forced, but each contributes 01 1110 own
1100 will. These are the deposits as it were made by devotion.
For that sum 10 disbursed not on banquets nor drinking bouts
nor unwillingly on eating-houses, but on the supporting and
ι burying 01 1110 poor, and on boys and girls deprived 01 property
and parents, and on aged servants 01 1110 1101100, 3100 011 ship-
wrecked persons, and any, who are in the mines or on islands
or in prisons‚ provided it be 101 1110 cause 01 God‘s religion,
who thus become pensioners 01 their confession. But the
working 01 11131 kind 01 love most 01 all bra-nds us with a mark
01 blame in the eyes 01 001110. ‘See,' they say, ‘how they love
one another’; 101 they themselves hate one another3 ‘and how
they are ready to die 101 0110 another'3 101 they will 00 111010
ready to kill one another. But also they rage at us for calling
one another brethren, 101 110 011101 reason, I suppose, than
because among themselves every name indicating blood relation-
ship is assumed 110111 affection. But we are also your brothers,
by right 01 nature, the one mother, although you are little
deserving 01 1110 name men, because you are evil brothers. But
how much more worthily are those both called and considered,
brethren who have recognised one Father, namely God, who have-⁷
imbibed one spirit 01 1101111000, who from one womb 01 1110 same g
ignorance have quaked before one light 01 truth! But we are

perhaps regarded as less legitimate for the reason that no

tragedy proclaims aloud our brotherliness, or because we are

brothers as the result 01 household possessions, which among

you generally break up the relationship 01 brothers. And so

we, who are united in heart and soul, have no hesitation about

sharing a thing. Among us all things are common except wives.

In this matter alone we dissolve partnership, in which alone

all other men practise partnership, who not only use the wives
