also that is foul; so that I wonder, when« the victims are tested
among you by vicious priests, when any one judges the hearts
rather 01 the victims than of the 33011110οΓ3 themselves. There-
1010 101 hooks thus dig into us w hile our hands are spread out to
God, let 0103303 suspend us, let fires play about us, let swords
behead us, let wild- beasts leap upon us, the 170157 3111111110 01
the praying Christian 13 ready 101· every kind 01 capital punish-
ment. Τ1113 13 your duty, ye excellent governors, wrench 0111

3 30111 that 13 praying 10 God for the emperor. The crime will
' be found there, where 13 the truth 01 3 God and piety 10 him.

CHAP. XXXI. Now 111057 1011 113 that we have fawned upon
the emperor and uttered lying prayers, 01 0011130 with the
‘view 01 escaping violence. Clearly this deception 13 10 our
benefit ; 101 57011 allow that we make good whatever point we
defend. You therefore who have thought that we care nothing
101 the 3310157 01 1110 Caesars, look into our Scripture, the 0130103
01 God, which we ourselves (10 1101 conceal and many accidents
bring into the hands 01 strangers. Know from these that we
are taught to the point 01 superfiuity 01 kindness even to pray
God 101 0111 0110111103 and to entreat benefits 101 0111 110130-

· 0111013. Who are to 3 greater extent enemies and persecutors

 

01 1110 Christians than those about whose majesty we are
arraigned? But even by name and clearly: ‘Pray, ⁷ says (the
scripture), ‘for kings and 101 0111013 31111 101 powers, that all
things may be at peace 101 57011. ⁷ For when the empire is
31131101011, 31111 when the othe 1 113113 01 11 3130 310 shattered,
we too 01 0011130, although the 0101111 00113111013 113 foreigners,
are involved in some quarter 01 the disaster.

CHAP. XXXII. There is also another greater necessity 101
113 10 111357 101 emperors, even 101 the whole state 01 the Empire
and the 1011111103 01 Rome, since we know that the great force
which is threatening the whole world and the end 113011 01 11701111-
111310157 which threatens terrible affiictions is being kept back
by the respite granted to the Roman empire. Therefore we
are unwilling to experience this, and while we pray 101· 113 post—
ponement we are favouring the long 001111111131100 01 Rome. But
we also 3117 031, though not by the genii 01 the Caesar,s yet by
their 331015, which 13 111010 divine than any genii. Do 57011 not
know that genii is a 1131110 101 daemone-s· and 101 (Iaemonza, a
diminutive word derived 110111 it? We look up 10 the judgment
01 God in the emperors, 101 Ηο 301 them over the 13003 01 1110
world. We know that that is in them which God willed, and
30 we wish that also to be 3310 which God willed, and 1170 consider
