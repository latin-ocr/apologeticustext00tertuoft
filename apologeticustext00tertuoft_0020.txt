gists than Le ΝΟΜ-1)* (whose Apparatus, Par. 1715, is reprinted
in Migne and in Oehler) and Christian Kortholt (15 Jan.
16:331—3] March 1694), whose ‘Paganus obtrectator’ (Kiel
,1698 110, 2nd ed. Lubeck.1703 4to), comment. on Iust. M.‚
Athenag, Theophil., Tatian (ibid. 1675 fol. ‘profundae erudi-
tionis‚’ says Walch); ‘de persecutionibus ecclesiae primaeuae>
(Kiel 1689 4130) and other works (see the Bodleian catalogue
and Joecher) are in my judgement still necessary to the student.
If Mr Carstens, in a slight article in the Allg. deutsche Bio-
graphie XVI (Leipz. 1882) 726 says that K.'s books “have been
long overtaken by the advance of science and have no longer
any importance,’' Ι comfort myself by the remembrance that
this Biography is weakest in the lives and works of scholars.
1 should like to cross-exainine Mr Carstens on Kortholt.
Of works on the other apologists that of Semisch on Justin
and Keim’s Celsus, are, so far as Ι know, the most helpful.
Beside printed sources, my ideal editor should inquire for
nianuscriptsl. My mouth watered when 1 read Blunt’s casual

1 [May I again call attention to the fact that there is a tenth-century MS
of chapters 38, 39 and part of 40 of the Apoloqeticus in the Kantons-Bibliothek
at Ziirich (Rheinau xcv), which is closely related to the lost Fulda MS (Journal
of leeoloql'cal Sludies, V111 (1906-1907), pp. 297—300)? This fact has been
overlooked by Rauschen and others. AJSQ why has it been left to me to point
out that the MS containing “Tertulliani Quaedam,” alluded to by Oehler,
vol. Ι, p. xxi, after Montfaucon Bibl. bibl. tom. Ι, p. 1134, as in the catalogue
of the library of St Germa'm-des-Pres, and doubtless identical with the MS of
the Α polcqeticus at Petrograd, also alluded to by Oehler (p. xii), is still as a
matter of fact at Petrograd (Q. v. 1, No. 40), having been brought there by
Peter Dubrowsky? It is of the ninth century, is probably the oldest existing
MS of the Apoloqeticzcs, and is mentioned in K. Gillert's catalogue, printed in
the Neue-s Archiv, v (1880), 241—265, 597—6l7‚ VI (1881), 497—512, and
described (with a photograph of one page) in A. Staerk, Les Manuscrz'ts Latius
du 1⁸³ (ιιι X l I I ‘³ Siecle consere-ds ἁ la. Bibliotheque I mpe'riaie de saint-Pdaersbourq
<2 tomes, St Petersbourg, 1910), Tome 1, p. 130, Tome Π, planche 57. Further,
Kroymann, the new Vienna editor of Tertullian, is entirely ignorant of the
Luxemburg MS of Tertullian, no. 75 (saec. xv ex.)‚ though it appears to have
lnccn used by Scmler, and a catalogue of the Luxemburg collection was published
in 1894. The MS contains carn. Chr., carn. resurr„ cor. mil, mart„ paenit.,
uirg. uel„ hab. mul„ cult. fem„ ad ux. 1 and ΙΙ, de fug. in pers„ Scap„ exh.
east„ monog„ pall„ pat. Dei (sic), adu. Prax„ adu. Va1., adu. Marc„ adu. Iud„
adu. omn. haer„ praescr. her„ adu. Hermog. The contents thus bear a striking
resemblance to those of certain Italian MSS, e.g.Vat.Urb.64 (saec. xv), described
by Kroymann in the first article mentioned on p. xi, pp. 4, 5. A. S.]
