APOLOGETIOVS 26, 27 93

J udea would never have reigned in the past, since she disdained
all these ordinary divinities3 and yet ye Romans 101· 801110 011110
honoured her God with victims, her temple with gifts and her
people with 01030108, 1101 would you ever have ruled over her, 11
8110 had not sinned against God and finally against Christ also,

CHAP. XXVII. This meets the charge 01 injury to your
gods, since we cannot be supposed to injure that which we
have shown to be non-existent. Therefore when we are
challenged to sacrifice, we make a stand against it 011 0110
strength 01 0111 conscience, whereby we are assured who those
are to whom these services extend under the profanation 01
images and the deification 01 1111111311 names. But some think
it madness that, when we might both sacrifice at the time and
depart uninjured, while retaining our own private opinions, we
should prefer stubbornness to safety. Forsooth you are giving
us advice how to take advantage 01 you; but we recognise the
source 01 811011 hints, who it is that prompts all this, and how
at one time by cunning advice, at another by harsh cruelty,
he is working towards the overthrow 01 0111 firmness. Assuredly
that spirit 01 daemonic1 and angelic nature, which, being our
enemy on account 01 108 separation (from God) and being
jealous on account 01 0110 favour 01 God (shown to us), wars
against us from the 10101088 01 your minds, which by a secret
influence are regulated and equipped 101 311 01130 perversity 01
judgment and unfairness 01 cruelty which we began to describe
at the outset. For although all the power 01 daemons and spirits
01 01130 kind is subject to us, yet like worthless people and slaves
they sometimes mingle obstinacy with 1031, 311(1 310 eager to
injure those, 01 whom at another time they are afraid: 101 even
1031 1110301108 hatred. Furthermore their hopeless state, arising
110111 0110 fact 01 011011 being foredoomed‚ gleans 110111 0110 delay
01 punishment the solace 01 enjoying their evil disposition during
the meantime. And yet when they are seized they are subdued
and yield to 0110111300, 311(1 011080 whom they attack 3131 011, they
supplicate when they are nigh. Therefore when, like rebellious
slaves, confined in barracoons or prisons or mines 01 quarries
or suffering any other penal servitude 01 01118 kind, they break
out against us in whose power they are, knowing full well both
that they are ill-matched and that they are thus all the more
undone, we resist them against our will as equals and attack
them in return, continuing in that which they attack, and we
never triumph over them more than when we are condemned 101
0110 persistence 01 0111 belief.
