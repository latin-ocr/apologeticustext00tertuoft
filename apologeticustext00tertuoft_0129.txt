pray 101· 11115 in the case 01 3 new Caesar. But it 15 1110 111011, you
say. Though it 15 1110 111011, yet they are Romans, and none
demand the Christians 101 punishment more eagerly than the
mob.' No doubt the other classes 01 society, in proportion
to their authority, are religious from conviction; nothing
hostile breathes from the senate 115011, 110111 1110 knights, 110111
1110 army, from the palace 115011. Whence come the Cassii and
the Nigri and the Albini? Whence those who besiege Caesar
between the two hay-trees? Whence those who practise gym-
nastic exercises in order to strangle him? Whence those who
rush armed into the palace, more reckless than all the number 01
1110 Sigerii and Parthenii? All come 110111 among the Romans, 11
