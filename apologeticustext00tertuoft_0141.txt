111 righteousness. This meeting together 01 Christians would
have been deservedly illegal, I admit, 11 it were the same as
the illegal, deservedly to be condemned, if any one complains 01
11 with the same accusation as is made about clubs. For whose
ruin have we ever met? We are the same when gathered
together as we are when scattered, we are as a body what we
are also as individuals, injuring no one, paining no one. When
worthy, when good men come together, when the pious and
pure are gathered together, it is to be called not a club, but a
council chamber.

CHAP. XL. But on the contrary the name 01 1001100 15 to
be applied to those who conspire to foment hatred against good
and worthy persons, who cry aloud against the blood 01 the
innocent, pretending forsooth in (10101100 01 their hatred that
10011511 excuse besides, that the Christians are to blame for
every publio disaster, every misfortune that happens to the
people. Ι1 1110 Tiber rises to the walls, 11 1110 Ν110 does not
rise to the fields, 11 the sky is rainless, 11 there 15 00 earthquake,
a famine, a plague, immediately the cry arises, ‘The Christians
10 1110 lion ! ² What! so many to one (lionfl I pray you tell
me: before the time 01 Tiberius, that is, before the coming
01 ( ’1111511 how many disasters smote the world or particular
cities'? We read that Hiera, Anaphe and Delos and Rhodes
and Ophiusa1 were ruined with many thousands 01 persons.
Plato also mentions that a land greater than Asia or Africa
was snatched away by the Atlantic Ocean. But an earth-
1100κο 0150 drained the Corinthian sea, and the force 01 the
waves cut off Lucania and banished it to bear the name 01
Sicily. These things 01 course could not happen without harm
to the inhabitants. But where were at that time, I will not
say, the Christians who think no'thing 01 your gods, but your
gods themselves, when a flood overwhelmed the whole world, or,
05 Plato supposed, only the plains? For, that your gods are
later than the catastrophe 01 the flood, is attested by the very
cities in which they were born and died, or even which they
founded3 for otherwise they would not have remained to-day,
11 they had not been later than that disaster. Palestine had not
yet received its Jewish swarm from Egypt, nor yet had the
beginning 01 the Christian sect settled there, when a shower 01
fire burnt up the neighbouring regions 01 Sodom and Gomorrha.
