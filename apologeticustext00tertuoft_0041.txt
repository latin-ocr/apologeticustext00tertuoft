this also men may know that Christians are free from those
failings, of the existence of which in themselves their critics are
unconscious3 and that they may at the same time blush, while
they accuse us—I do not say the worst accusing the best, but
rather (as they themselves would have it) ordinary persons
accusing their fellows. We will meet each of the secret scandals
laid to our charge by appealing to the same acts committed
openly, acts in which we are held to show ourselves wicked,

since when the truth of 0111 031186 1116618 you at every turn, the
authority of the laws is at last set up against it, so that either
it is said that nothing is to be reconsidered after the laws have

Do you wonder either that a man should have made a mistake
