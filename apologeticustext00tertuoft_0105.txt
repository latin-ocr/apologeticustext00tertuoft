point onward there must be a presentation 01 1110 thing itself,
by which we shall show that the nature 01 gods and daemons
is one. Let any one be produced in this very place under your
tribunals, who it is well known is under the infiuence 01 3
daemon3 that spirit, 11 ordered by any Christian to speak, will
as readily confess 113011 3 daemon, because it is true, as elsewhere
a god because it is untrue. Let someone likewise be brought
forward from among those who are thought to be under the
influence 01 3 god, men who by breathing on altars acquire
a divine power from the odour 01 the sacrifice, who are cured
by exhaling, and force an utterance as they pant. This very
Maiden 01 1110 Heavens‚ the promiser 01 131113, 11113 very Aescu-
lapius, the discoverer 01 011103, 1110 111111131013 01 another day to
Socordius, Tenatius and Asclepiodotus, men doomed to die*
unless they confess themselves daemons, not daring to lie to
a Christian, forthwith shed the blood 01 11131 111031 1113010111
Christian! What could be more evident than a fact like this?
what more trustworthy than this demonstration? The sim-
plicity 01 1111111 13 101 311 eyes to see, its own excellence supports
it, suspicion is impossible. Do you say this result comes from
magio or some deception 01 11131 kind? You will not say it,
(even) 11 your eyes and ears allow you. But what 0311 be in-
sinuated against that which is set forth in its naked simplicity?
If, 011 1110 0110 hand, they are truly gods, why do they say falsely
that they are daemons? is it that they may please us? Ι1 30,
111011 your divinity is already subject to Christians, and that is
not to be considered divinity which is subject to a man, and
(11 aught can add to the disgrace) to its actual 1003. If on the
other hand they are daemons or angels, why do they answer
that they play the part 01 gods elsewhere? For, just as those
who are considered gods would have refused to call themselves
daemons, 11 they had been truly gods, 01 0011130 lest-they should
depose themselves from their high dignity, so also these whom
you know at once to be daemons, would not dare elsewhere to
pose as gods, 11 111030 gods whose names they usurp were gods 01
any sort at all, since they would be afraid to misuse those higher
dignities which, without doubt, they would also have to dread.
Therefore this divinity which you hold 1331 13 non-existent:
101, 11 11 existed, it would neither be claimed by spirits in con-
fession, 1101 denied by gods. Since then both sides agree to our
admission, denying that the gods exist, you must recognise that
there is one class only, viz. daemons, but that it is on both sides.
You must now secl< 101 110311 gods, since those you had assumed
to exist, you learn are daemons. But by this same aid 110111 113,
