APOLOGETICVS 13 47

some of you are worshipping one god, some another, of course
you slight the feelings of those whom you do not worship:
preference of one is impossible without insult to another, since
one cannot even choose without implied blame. It follows
therefore that you lightly esteem those of whom you disapprove,
and whom you do not sear to offend by your disapproval. For,
as I hinted above, the position of each god depended on the
opinion of the senate. He was no god, whom a man, when
consulted, had declined to deify, and by his refusal had con-
demned. Your household gods, whom you call Lares, you deal
with according to your household rights, pledging, advertising,
changing them, sometimes from a Saturn into a cooking-pot,
sometimes from a Minerva into a ladle, as each god happens to
be worn and damaged with long adoration, as each master has
found a more sacred deity in his domestic need. Your public
gods you profane equally by public authority, while you keep
them as sources of revenue in the auction-catalogue. Thus the
Capitol, thus the vegetable market is attended by the bidders;
under the same voice of the crier, under the same spear, under
the same entry made by the quaestor, divinity is knocked down
to the highest bidder. But indeed lands charged with tribute
are cheaper, and persons rated at a tax are less noble (for these
are the marks of serfdom): but the gods who bring in more
tribute are more holy, or rather those who are more holy, bring
in more tribute. Their majesty is made a matter of profit.
Religion goes begging about the taverns. You demand pay-
ment for the ground on which a temple standS, for permission
to approach the sacred place ; you cannot be acquainted with
the gods for nothing, they have their price. What do you do
at all to honour them, which you do not also bestow on your
dead? Both alike have their temples and altars. The dress
is the same, the ornaments on their dress the same. The
god corresponds in age, skill, and business to the dead man.
What differenee is there between a funeral feast and a banquet
to J upiterZ between a sacrificial and a funeral chance? an under-
taker and a soothsayer? for a soothsayer also attends upon
the dead. But you worthily confer the honour of divinity on
emperors when dead, since even in their lifetime you assign it
to them. Your gods will give you credit for it, nay rather they
will thank you for making their masters equal to them. But
when you worship Larentina, a common whore—would it were
at least a Lais or a Phryne—, among the J unos and the Cereses
and the Dianas, when you hallow the name of Simon Magus
with the statue and inscription of a holy god, when you make
some court page a member of the college of gods, although the
