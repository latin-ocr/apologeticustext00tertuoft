vehement supporterS. ‘What a fine woman! How merry,
how debonairl' ‘What a fine fellow, what a sport, what a
gallantl' They have become Christians. Thus is the name
applied to their reformation. Some even make a bargain with
this hatred at the 0051 01 their interests‚ ready to put up with
113101, provided that what they hate is not mixed up with their
home-life. A husband now no longer jealous has turned out of
doors his now chaste wife: a father, patient in the past, has
disinherited his now obedient son: a once forgiving master has
banished from his sight a now faithful servant. In 03011 0350
1110 10101111 011001οᾶ by the name 01 Christian is the ground 01
offence. Goodness 15 1101 01 such account as hatred 01 1110
Christians. Now therefore if it is a name that 15 hated what
charge can there be against a name, what prosecution 01 words,
unless it be that 3 particular utterance 01 3 word has a barbarous
or ill-omened or 3 scurrilous 01 110111οᾱ051 sound? The name
Christian indeed, 50 131 35 115 meaning is concerned, is derived
from ‘anointing’ And even when it 15 wrongly pronounced
‘Chreestiais' by you——for neither 15 there any real knowledge
of the name among you—it is made up from sweetness 01 kind-
ness. And thus even an innocent name gets hated in the case of
innocent men. But indeed there can be no doubt that the sect
is 1131οᾶ 10 1110 031110 01 115 Founder. What novelty is there in
a school of thought bringing on its followers a name taken from
its teacher'? Are not philosophers named after their founders,
eg. Platonists, Epicureans, Pythagoream? or even from their
places of meeting and their stations, as Stoios or Academicsie
50 too physicians from Erasistratus, and grammarians from
Aristarchus, and even cooks from Apicius? And yet the pro-
fession of 3 03010, handed down with the institution from the
founder himself, causes no 0110000. T 0 be sure, if any one should
prove a sect to be evil, and thus the originator also to be evil,
he will prove the name to be likewise evil, worthy of hatred
from the guilt attaching 10 the sect and its founder. Hence,
before hating the name, it were fitting first to convict the sect
from the character of the founder, or the founder from the

character of the sect. But, as matters are, though the in· f

vestigation and> examination of both are neglected‚ the name is
laid hold 01, the name is made the object of attack, and a mere
word prejudges a sect and its founder (though both are equally
unknown) simply because they bear a name, not because they

are convioted 01 guilt. ’
