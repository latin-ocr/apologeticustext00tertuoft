fact that they inhabit the air and 11001 the neighbourhood 01
the stars and from their dealings with the clouds they are able
to have knowledge 01 the preparations in heaven, so that they
can even promise ‘rains which they already feel. They are also
clearly sorcerers1 in their treatments 01 disease. For they first
injure, and then prescribe remedies to excite wonder, whether
simply new or absolutely opposed to the usual practices, after
which they cease to injure, and are (thus) believed to have
effected a cure. Why then should Ι speak 01 other subtilties
or even powers 01 spiritual deception? the appearances 01 the

angels and daemons work the same things as your gods also
work, where then lies the preeminence 01 divinity, which must
01 course be believed to be superior to every (other) power?
Will it not then be more fitting to assume that it is the persons
themselves who make themselves gods, since they display the
same actions which produce belief in divinity, than to imagine
that the gods are merely on a level with angels and daemons?
A distinction is made, I suppose, according to the (1111616006 of
